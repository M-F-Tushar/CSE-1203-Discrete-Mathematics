# Comprehensive Graph Theory Study Guide

## Chapter 1: Basic Graph Concepts

### 1.1 Paths and Circuits

**Definition**: A **path** in a graph is a sequence of vertices where each adjacent pair is connected by an edge. A **circuit** is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex.

**Key Properties**:
- **Simple path**: No repeated vertices (except possibly first and last for circuits)
- **Length of path**: Number of edges in the path
- **Circuit**: A closed path where the first and last vertices are the same

### 1.2 Connected Graphs

**Definition**: A graph is **connected** if there exists a path between every pair of vertices.

**Connected Components**: Maximal connected subgraphs within a disconnected graph.

## Chapter 2: Exercises and Solutions

### Exercise Set 1: Path Analysis

**Exercise 1**: Does each list of vertices form a path in the following graph? Which paths are simple? Which are circuits? What are the lengths of those that are paths?

**Given options**:
- a) a, c, b, c, b
- b) a, c, e, d, b, c, a
- c) e, b, a, d, b, e
- d) c, b, d, a, e, c

**Solution Approach**:
1. Check if consecutive vertices are connected by edges
2. Identify if any vertices repeat (simple vs non-simple)
3. Check if first and last vertices are the same (circuit)
4. Count the number of edges (length)

**Exercise 2**: Similar analysis for a second graph with options:
- a) a, b, e, c, b

**Exercise 3-5**: Determine whether given graphs are connected.

**Analysis Method**:
1. Start from any vertex
2. Use depth-first or breadth-first search
3. Check if all vertices are reachable
4. If not all vertices reachable → disconnected

### Exercise Set 3: Connected Components (Exercise 6)

**Exercise 6**: How many connected components does each graph have? Find each component.

**Solution Steps**:
