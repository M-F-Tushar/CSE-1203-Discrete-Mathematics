## 10.2.2 Basic Terminology for Undirected Graphs

### Definition 1: Adjacent Vertices and Incident Edges
**Adjacent (Neighbors)**: Two vertices u and v in an undirected graph G are called adjacent if they are endpoints of an edge e in G.

**Incident**: An edge e is incident with vertices u and v if u and v are the endpoints of e. The edge e connects u and v.

### Definition 2: Neighborhood
**Neighborhood N(v)**: The set of all neighbors of a vertex v in graph G = (V, E).

**Extended Neighborhood N(A)**: For a subset A of V, N(A) is the set of all vertices adjacent to at least one vertex in A.
- Formula: N(A) = ⋃_{v∈A} N(v)

### Definition 3: Degree of a Vertex
**Degree deg(v)**: The number of edges incident with vertex v.
- **Special case**: A loop at a vertex contributes 2 to the vertex's degree (since both endpoints are the same vertex)

### Example 1: Finding Degrees and Neighborhoods

**Given**: Graphs G and H as described in the document

**Graph G Analysis**:
- deg(a) = 2, deg(b) = 4, deg(c) = 4, deg(d) = 1, deg(e) = 3, deg(f) = 4, deg(g) = 0
- N(a) = {b, f}
- N(b) = {a, c, e, f}
- N(c) = {b, d, e, f}
- N(d) = {c}
- N(e) = {b, c, f}
- N(f) = {a, b, c, e}
- N(g) = ∅ (empty set)

**Graph H Analysis**:
- deg(a) = 4, deg(b) = 6, deg(c) = 1, deg(d) = 5, deg(e) = 6
- N(a) = {b, d, e}
- N(b) = {a, b, c, d, e} (note: includes itself due to loop)
- N(c) = {b}
- N(d) = {a, b, e}
- N(e) = {a, b, d}

### Special Vertex Types
- **Isolated Vertex**: A vertex of degree zero (not adjacent to any vertex)
  - Example: Vertex g in Graph G
- **Pendant Vertex**: A vertex of degree one (adjacent to exactly one other vertex)
  - Example: Vertex d in Graph G

### Example 2: Niche Overlap Graph Application

In a niche overlap graph (ecological model):
- **Vertex degree**: Represents the number of species that compete with the species represented by that vertex
- **Pendant vertex**: Represents a species that competes with exactly one other species
- **Isolated vertex**: Represents a species that doesn't compete with any other species

**Specific example**: The squirrel vertex has degree 4 because it competes with four species: crow, opossum, raccoon, and woodpecker. The mouse is pendant because it only competes with the shrew.

## 10.2.3 The Handshaking Theorem

### Theorem 1: The Handshaking Theorem
For an undirected graph G = (V, E) with m edges:

**2m = ∑_{v∈V} deg(v)**

**Explanation**: The sum of all vertex degrees equals twice the number of edges because each edge contributes 2 to the total degree sum (one for each endpoint).

### Example 3: Applying the Handshaking Theorem
**Problem**: How many edges are in a graph with 10 vertices, each of degree 6?

**Solution**:
- Sum of degrees = 6 × 10 = 60
- By Handshaking Theorem: 2m = 60
- Therefore: m = 30 edges

### Theorem 2: Even Number of Odd-Degree Vertices
**Statement**: An undirected graph has an even number of vertices of odd degree.

**Proof Outline**:
1. Divide vertices into V₁ (even degree) and V₂ (odd degree)
2. 2m = ∑_{v∈V₁} deg(v) + ∑_{v∈V₂} deg(v)
3. Since 2m is even and ∑_{v∈V₁} deg(v) is even, ∑_{v∈V₂} deg(v) must be even
4. Since each term in ∑_{v∈V₂} deg(v) is odd, there must be an even number of terms

## 10.2.4 Directed Graph Terminology

### Definition 4: Adjacent Vertices in Directed Graphs
For edge (u, v) in a directed graph:
- **u is adjacent to v**
- **v is adjacent from u**
- **u is the initial vertex**
- **v is the terminal (end) vertex**

### Definition 5: In-degree and Out-degree
- **In-degree deg⁻(v)**: Number of edges with v as terminal vertex
- **Out-degree deg⁺(v)**: Number of edges with v as initial vertex
- **Loop contribution**: A loop contributes 1 to both in-degree and out-degree

### Example 4: Calculating In-degrees and Out-degrees
**Given**: Directed graph G as described

**In-degrees**: deg⁻(a) = 2, deg⁻(b) = 2, deg⁻(c) = 3, deg⁻(d) = 2, deg⁻(e) = 3, deg⁻(f) = 0

**Out-degrees**: deg⁺(a) = 4, deg⁺(b) = 1, deg⁺(c) = 2, deg⁺(d) = 2, deg⁺(e) = 3, deg⁺(f) = 0

### Theorem 3: Sum of In-degrees Equals Sum of Out-degrees
For directed graph G = (V, E):

**∑_{v∈V} deg⁻(v) = ∑_{v∈V} deg⁺(v) = |E|**

**Explanation**: Each edge contributes exactly 1 to some vertex's in-degree and exactly 1 to some vertex's out-degree.

## 10.2.5 Special Simple Graphs

### Example 5: Complete Graphs
**Complete Graph Kₙ**: A simple graph containing exactly one edge between each pair of distinct vertices.

**Properties**:
- Kₙ has n vertices
- Kₙ has C(n,2) = n(n-1)/2 edges
- Every vertex has degree n-1

**Examples**: K₁, K₂, K₃, K₄, K₅, K₆ (as shown in figures)

### Example 6: Cycles
**Cycle Cₙ (n ≥ 3)**: A graph with n vertices v₁, v₂, ..., vₙ and edges forming a closed loop.

**Structure**:
- Vertices: v₁, v₂, ..., vₙ
- Edges: {v₁, v₂}, {v₂, v₃}, ..., {vₙ₋₁, vₙ}, {vₙ, v₁}
- Every vertex has degree 2
- Total of n edges

**Examples**: C₃ (triangle), C₄ (square), C₅ (pentagon), C₆ (hexagon)

### Example 7: Wheels
**Wheel Wₙ**: Created by adding a central vertex to cycle Cₙ and connecting it to all vertices in the cycle.

**Properties**:
- n + 1 vertices total
- 2n edges total
- Central vertex has degree n
- Rim vertices have degree 3

**Examples**: W₃, W₄, W₅, W₆

### Example 8: n-Cubes (Hypercubes)
**n-Cube Qₙ**: A graph with vertices representing all possible n-bit binary strings, where two vertices are adjacent if their bit strings differ in exactly one position.

**Properties**:
- 2ⁿ vertices
- Each vertex has degree n
- Total edges: n × 2ⁿ⁻¹

**Construction Method**:
1. Start with Qₙ
2. Make two copies
3. Prefix one copy's labels with 0, other with 1
4. Connect corresponding vertices

- Q₁: vertices {0, 1}, one edge
- Q₂: vertices {00, 01, 10, 11}, forms a square
- Q₃: vertices {000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111}, forms a cube

## 10.2.6 Bipartite Graphs

### Definition 6: Bipartite Graph
**Bipartite Graph**: A simple graph G whose vertex set V can be partitioned into two disjoint sets V₁ and V₂ such that every edge connects a vertex in V₁ to a vertex in V₂.

**Bipartition**: The pair (V₁, V₂) that partitions the vertex set.

### Example 9: C₆ is Bipartite
**Demonstration**:
- V₁ = {v₁, v₃, v₅}
- V₂ = {v₂, v₄, v₆}
- Every edge connects a vertex from V₁ to a vertex from V₂

### Example 10: K₃ is Not Bipartite
**Proof**: In K₃, if we divide vertices into two sets, one set must contain two vertices. These two vertices are connected by an edge (since K₃ has all possible edges), violating the bipartite condition.

### Example 11: Testing Bipartiteness
**Graph G**: Bipartite with partition ({a, b, d}, {c, e, f, g})
**Graph H**: Not bipartite (cannot partition vertices a, b, f without having edges within the same partition)

### Theorem 4: Two-Coloring Criterion
**Statement**: A simple graph is bipartite if and only if it's possible to assign one of two colors to each vertex so that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.

**Proof Structure**:
- **If bipartite → two-colorable**: Assign one color to V₁, another to V₂
- **If two-colorable → bipartite**: Let V₁ = vertices of color 1, V₂ = vertices of color 2

### Example 12: Using Two-Coloring to Test Bipartiteness
**Graph G**:
1. Assign red to vertex a
2. Must assign blue to c, e, f, g (adjacent to a)
3. Must assign red to b, d (adjacent to blue vertices)
4. Check: all edges connect red and blue vertices ✓
5. Conclusion: G is bipartite

**Graph H**:
1. Assign red to vertex a
2. Must assign blue to b, e, f (adjacent to a)
3. Problem: e and f are adjacent but both must be blue ✗
4. Conclusion: H is not bipartite

### Example 13: Complete Bipartite Graphs
**Complete Bipartite Graph Kₘ,ₙ**: A bipartite graph with vertex sets of sizes m and n, where every vertex in the first set is connected to every vertex in the second set.

**Properties**:
- m + n vertices total
- m × n edges total
- Vertices in first set have degree n
- Vertices in second set have degree m

**Examples**: K₂,₃, K₃,₃, K₃,₅, K₂,₆

## 10.2.7 Bipartite Graphs and Matchings

### Matching Definitions
**Matching M**: A subset of edges where no two edges share a common vertex.

**Matched Vertex**: A vertex that is an endpoint of an edge in the matching.

**Unmatched Vertex**: A vertex not included in any edge of the matching.

**Maximum Matching**: A matching with the largest possible number of edges.

**Complete Matching**: In a bipartite graph with bipartition (V₁, V₂), a complete matching from V₁ to V₂ means every vertex in V₁ is matched.

### Example 14: Job Assignment Problem
**Scenario 1 - Project 1**:
- Employees: Alvarez, Berkowitz, Chen, Davis
- Jobs: requirements, architecture, implementation, testing
- Training matrix:
  - Alvarez: requirements, testing
  - Berkowitz: architecture, implementation, testing
  - Chen: requirements, architecture, implementation
  - Davis: requirements

**Solution**: Complete matching found:
- Davis → requirements
- Chen → architecture
- Berkowitz → implementation
- Alvarez → testing

**Scenario 2 - Project 2**:
- Different employee capabilities
- **Problem**: Only 2 employees (Xuan, Ziegler) can do requirements, implementation, or testing
- **Conclusion**: No complete matching possible for all 4 jobs

### Example 15: Marriage Problem
**Model**: Bipartite graph where V₁ = men, V₂ = women, edges represent mutual acceptability.
- **Matching**: Set of married couples
- **Maximum matching**: Largest possible set of marriages
- **Complete matching**: Every man is married (but not necessarily every woman)

### Theorem 5: Hall's Marriage Theorem
**Statement**: A bipartite graph G with bipartition (V₁, V₂) has a complete matching from V₁ to V₂ if and only if |N(A)| ≥ |A| for all subsets A of V₁.

**Intuitive Meaning**: For any subset of vertices in V₁, there must be at least as many neighbors in V₂.

**Proof Structure**:
1. **Necessity (→)**: If complete matching exists, then |N(A)| ≥ |A|
2. **Sufficiency (←)**: If |N(A)| ≥ |A| for all A ⊆ V₁, then complete matching exists (proved by strong induction)

## 10.2.9 New Graphs from Old

### Definition 7: Subgraph
**Subgraph H = (W, F)** of graph G = (V, E): W ⊆ V and F ⊆ E

**Proper Subgraph**: H ≠ G

### Definition 8: Induced Subgraph
**Induced Subgraph**: Given vertex subset W ⊆ V, the induced subgraph contains all edges from the original graph that have both endpoints in W.

### Example 18: Subgraph Construction
Given K₅, we can create various subgraphs by:
- Removing vertices and their incident edges
- Removing specific edges
- Taking induced subgraphs on vertex subsets

### Graph Operations

**Removing an Edge (G - e)**:
- Same vertex set V
- Edge set E - {e}
- Result: G - e = (V, E - {e})

**Adding an Edge (G + e)**:
- Same vertex set V
- Edge set E ∪ {e}
- Result: G + e = (V, E ∪ {e})

**Edge Contraction**:
- Remove edge e with endpoints u, v
- Merge u and v into new vertex w
- Connect w to all former neighbors of u and v
- Result is not a subgraph of original graph

**Removing a Vertex (G - v)**:
- Vertex set V - {v}
- Remove all edges incident to v
- Result: G - v = (V - {v}, E')

### Example 19: Graph Operations Demonstration
Starting with graph G, we can create:
1. **G - {b,c}**: Remove edge between b and c
2. **G + {e,d}**: Add edge between e and d
3. **Edge contraction**: Replace edge {b,c} with new vertex f
4. **G - c**: Remove vertex c and all its incident edges

### Definition 9: Graph Union
**Union G₁ ∪ G₂**: For simple graphs G₁ = (V₁, E₁) and G₂ = (V₂, E₂):
- Vertex set: V₁ ∪ V₂
- Edge set: E₁ ∪ E₂

### Example 20: Graph Union
Given graphs G₁ and G₂:
- G₁ ∪ G₂ has vertex set {a, b, c, d, e, f}
- Edge set is union of both graphs' edges
- Result combines all vertices and edges from both graphs
