# Graph Theory: Connectivity - Complete Study Guide

## 10.4.1 Introduction

Graph connectivity is fundamental to understanding how elements in a network can communicate or interact. Many real-world problems can be modeled using paths along graph edges:

- **Network Communication**: Determining if messages can be sent between computers
- **Route Planning**: Mail delivery, garbage pickup optimization
- **Network Diagnostics**: Fault detection and repair planning

## 10.4.2 Paths

### Informal Definition
A **path** is a sequence of edges that begins at a vertex and travels from vertex to vertex along the graph's edges, visiting vertices at the endpoints of these edges.

### Formal Definitions

#### Definition 1: Paths in Undirected Graphs
Let n be a nonnegative integer and G an undirected graph. A **path of length n** from u to v in G is:
- A sequence of n edges: e₁, e₂, ..., eₙ
- With corresponding vertex sequence: x₀ = u, x₁, ..., xₙ₋₁, xₙ = v
- Where edge eᵢ connects vertices xᵢ₋₁ and xᵢ

**Key Terms:**
- **Circuit**: A path that begins and ends at the same vertex (u = v) with length > 0
- **Simple Path/Circuit**: Does not contain the same edge more than once
- **Path of length zero**: Consists of a single vertex

**Notation**: In simple graphs, we can denote a path by its vertex sequence x₀, x₁, ..., xₙ

#### Definition 2: Paths in Directed Graphs
Similar to undirected graphs, but edges must be traversed in their specified direction:
- Edge eᵢ is associated with ordered pair (xᵢ₋₁, xᵢ)
- **Circuit/Cycle**: Path of length > 0 that begins and ends at same vertex

### Important Note on Terminology
Some texts use different terminology:
- **Walk**: Instead of "path"
- **Closed Walk**: Instead of "circuit"
- **Trail**: Simple path (no repeated edges)
- **Path**: Trail with no repeated vertices

### Example 1: Path Analysis
In the simple graph with vertices {a, b, c, d, e, f}:

**Valid Paths:**
- a, d, c, f, e is a simple path of length 4
- b, c, f, e, b is a circuit of length 4

**Invalid Paths:**
- d, e, c, a is not a path (no edge {e, c})
- a, b, e, d, a, b is not simple (contains edge {a, b} twice)

## 10.4.3 Real-World Applications

### Example 2: Acquaintanceship Graphs
**Concept**: People are vertices, friendships are edges
- A path between two people represents a chain of mutual acquaintances
- **Six Degrees of Separation**: Theory that most people are connected by ≤ 6 intermediate people
- This would mean paths of length ≤ 4 in the global acquaintanceship graph

### Example 3: Collaboration Graphs

#### Erdős Numbers
- **Definition**: Length of shortest path between mathematician and Paul Erdős
- Collaboration = co-authoring a mathematical paper
- **Statistics (2006)**:
  - Erdős number 0: 1 person (Erdős himself)
  - Erdős number 1: 504 people
  - Erdős number 2: 6,593 people
  - Maximum recorded: 13

#### Bacon Numbers (Hollywood Graph)
- **Definition**: Length of shortest path between actor and Kevin Bacon
- Collaboration = appearing in the same movie
- **Statistics (2017)**:
  - Bacon number 1: 3,452 actors
  - Bacon number 2: 401,636 actors
  - Bacon number 3: 1,496,104 actors
  - Maximum: 9

**Party Game**: Find shortest chain of movies connecting any actor to Kevin Bacon

## 10.4.4 Connectedness in Undirected Graphs

### Definition 3: Connected Graphs
An undirected graph is **connected** if there is a path between every pair of distinct vertices.

- **Disconnected**: Not connected
- **Disconnecting**: Removing vertices/edges to create disconnected subgraph

### Theorem 1: Simple Paths in Connected Graphs
**Statement**: There is a simple path between every pair of distinct vertices of a connected undirected graph.

**Proof Strategy**: 
1. Take any path between vertices u and v
2. If it's not simple (has repeated vertices), remove the loop
3. This creates a shorter path
4. The shortest path must be simple

### Connected Components

**Definition**: A **connected component** is a maximal connected subgraph - the largest connected subgraph containing a given vertex.

**Properties**:
- Components are disjoint
- Their union equals the original graph
- Every vertex belongs to exactly one component

### Example 4: Connectivity Analysis
Graph G₁: Connected (verify by finding paths between all vertex pairs)
Graph G₂: Disconnected (no path between vertices a and d)

### Example 5: Finding Connected Components
Given graph H with vertices {a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h}:
- Component H₁: {a, b, c}
- Component H₂: {d, e}  
- Component H₃: {f, g, h}

### Example 6: Telephone Call Graph Analysis
**AT&T Network Analysis**:
- 53,767,087 vertices (phone numbers)
- 170+ million edges (calls)
- 3.7+ million connected components
- Largest component: 44,989,297 vertices (80% of total)
- Maximum path length in largest component: 20 calls

## 10.4.5 Measuring Graph Connectivity

### Cut Vertices and Cut Edges

**Cut Vertex (Articulation Point)**: A vertex whose removal increases the number of connected components

**Cut Edge (Bridge)**: An edge whose removal increases the number of connected components

**Significance**: In network terms, these represent critical routers/links whose failure would disconnect the network.

### Example 7: Finding Cut Vertices and Edges
In graph G₁:
- **Cut vertices**: b, c, e
- **Cut edges**: {a, b}, {c, e}

### Vertex Connectivity

**Vertex Cut**: A set V' of vertices whose removal disconnects the graph

**Vertex Connectivity κ(G)**: Minimum number of vertices in a vertex cut
- For complete graphs: κ(Kₙ) = n - 1
- Range: 0 ≤ κ(G) ≤ n - 1
- κ(G) = 0 iff G is disconnected or G = K₁

**k-Connected**: A graph with κ(G) ≥ k
- **1-connected**: Connected (not single vertex)
- **2-connected/Biconnected**: No cut vertices, ≥3 vertices

### Example 8: Computing Vertex Connectivity
- G₁: κ(G₁) = 1 (has cut vertices)
- G₂: κ(G₂) = 1 (vertex c is a cut vertex)
- G₃: κ(G₃) = 2 (vertex cut {b, g})
- G₄: κ(G₄) = 2 (vertex cut {c, f})
- G₅: κ(G₅) = 3 (vertex cut {b, c, f})

### Edge Connectivity

**Edge Cut**: A set E' of edges whose removal disconnects the graph

**Edge Connectivity λ(G)**: Minimum number of edges in an edge cut
- Range: 0 ≤ λ(G) ≤ n - 1
- λ(G) = n - 1 iff G = Kₙ

### Example 9: Computing Edge Connectivity
- G₁: λ(G₁) = 1 (has cut edge)
- G₂: λ(G₂) = 2 (edge cut {{a,b}, {a,c}})
- G₃: λ(G₃) = 2 (edge cut {{b,c}, {f,g}})
- G₄: λ(G₄) = 3 (edge cut {{b,c}, {a,f}, {f,g}})
- G₅: λ(G₅) = 3 (edge cut {{a,b}, {a,g}, {a,h}})

### Fundamental Inequality
For any graph G:
**κ(G) ≤ λ(G) ≤ min_{v∈V} deg(v)**

**Explanation**:
- Removing all neighbors of minimum-degree vertex disconnects graph
- Removing all edges incident to minimum-degree vertex disconnects graph
- Vertex connectivity ≤ edge connectivity

### Applications of Connectivity

#### Data Networks
- **Vertices**: Routers
- **Edges**: Communication links  
- **κ(G)**: Minimum routers that must fail to disconnect network
- **λ(G)**: Minimum links that must fail to disconnect network

#### Highway Networks
- **Vertices**: Intersections
- **Edges**: Road segments
- **κ(G)**: Minimum intersections to close to disconnect network
- **λ(G)**: Minimum roads to close to disconnect network

## 10.4.6 Connectedness in Directed Graphs

### Definition 4: Strong Connectivity
A directed graph is **strongly connected** if there is a path from a to b AND from b to a for every pair of vertices a, b.

### Definition 5: Weak Connectivity  
A directed graph is **weakly connected** if there is a path between every two vertices when edge directions are ignored (in the underlying undirected graph).

**Relationship**: Strongly connected ⟹ Weakly connected

### Example 10: Directed Graph Connectivity
- Graph G: Strongly connected (paths exist in both directions between all vertices)
- Graph H: Weakly connected but not strongly connected (no directed path from a to b)

### Strong Components
**Strongly Connected Components**: Maximal strongly connected subgraphs

**Properties**:
- Components are either identical or disjoint
- Every vertex belongs to exactly one strong component

### Example 11: Finding Strong Components
Graph H has three strong components:
1. {a} (single vertex)
2. {e} (single vertex)  
3. {b, c, d} with edges forming a cycle

### Example 12: Web Graph Analysis
**1999 Web Graph**:
- 200+ million vertices (web pages)
- 1.5+ billion edges (links)
- **2010 estimates**: 55+ billion vertices, 1 trillion edges

**Structure**:
- ~90% of vertices in one weakly connected component
- **Giant Strongly Connected Component (GSCC)**: 53+ million vertices
- Three other regions of ~44 million vertices each:
  - Pages reachable from GSCC but don't link back
  - Pages linking to GSCC but unreachable from it  
  - Pages isolated from GSCC

## 10.4.7 Paths and Isomorphism

### Using Circuits to Detect Non-Isomorphism

**Isomorphic Invariant**: Existence of simple circuit of length k

**Strategy**: If graphs have different circuit structures, they cannot be isomorphic.

### Example 13: Circuit-Based Non-Isomorphism
Graphs G and H:
- Same vertices (6), edges (8), degree sequence
- H has simple circuit of length 3: v₁, v₂, v₆, v₁
- G has no simple circuit of length 3
- **Conclusion**: G and H are not isomorphic

### Using Paths to Find Isomorphisms

**Strategy**: Follow corresponding paths through both graphs, matching vertices with same degrees.

### Example 14: Path-Based Isomorphism
Graphs G and H:
- Same basic statistics and circuit lengths
- Path u₁, u₄, u₃, u₂, u₅ in G
- Path v₃, v₂, v₁, v₅, v₄ in H  
- Both paths have degree sequence: 3, 2, 3, 2, 2
- **Mapping**: f(u₁)=v₃, f(u₄)=v₂, f(u₃)=v₁, f(u₂)=v₅, f(u₅)=v₄
- **Result**: f is an isomorphism

## 10.4.8 Counting Paths Between Vertices

### Theorem 2: Adjacency Matrix Powers
Let G be a graph with adjacency matrix A. The number of different paths of length r from vertex vᵢ to vertex vⱼ equals the (i,j)th entry of Aʳ.

**Proof Outline** (by induction):
- **Base case**: A¹ gives number of length-1 paths (direct edges)
- **Inductive step**: Aʳ⁺¹ = AʳA combines r-length paths with 1-length extensions
- Entry (i,j) of Aʳ⁺¹ = Σₖ (paths of length r from i to k) × (edges from k to j)

### Example 15: Path Counting
For the 4-cycle graph with adjacency matrix:
```
A = [0 1 1 0]
    [1 0 0 1]  
    [1 0 0 1]
    [0 1 1 0]
```

Computing A⁴:
```
A⁴ = [8 0 0 8]
     [0 8 8 0]
     [0 8 8 0]  
     [8 0 0 8]
```

**Result**: 8 paths of length 4 from vertex a to vertex d

**Verification**: The eight paths are:
1. a,b,a,b,d  2. a,b,a,c,d  3. a,b,d,b,d  4. a,b,d,c,d
5. a,c,a,b,d  6. a,c,a,c,d  7. a,c,d,b,d  8. a,c,d,c,d

## Applications and Extensions

### Finding Shortest Paths
- Compute A¹, A², A³, ... until Aʳ has non-zero (i,j) entry
- The smallest r gives the shortest path length

### Testing Connectivity
- For n-vertex graph, compute A + A² + ... + Aⁿ⁻¹
- Graph is connected iff all entries are positive
