## Basic Graph Terminology

### Key Definitions

**Vertex (Node)**: A fundamental unit of a graph, representing an entity or point.

**Edge**: A connection between two vertices, representing a relationship.

**Undirected Graph**: A graph where edges have no direction - the connection between vertices A and B is the same as B to A.

**Directed Graph (Digraph)**: A graph where edges have direction - an edge from A to B is different from an edge from B to A.

**Simple Graph**: An undirected graph with no loops (edges connecting a vertex to itself) and no multiple edges between the same pair of vertices.

**Multigraph**: A graph that allows multiple edges between the same pair of vertices.

**Pseudograph**: A graph that allows both loops and multiple edges.

### Special Vertex Types

**Isolated Vertex**: A vertex with degree 0 (no edges connected to it).

**Pendant Vertex**: A vertex with degree 1 (connected to exactly one other vertex).

---

## Degree Concepts

### Degree in Undirected Graphs

**Degree of a vertex**: The number of edges incident to (connected to) that vertex.
- Notation: deg(v) for vertex v
- Loops count as 2 toward the degree (since a loop connects a vertex to itself twice)

### Degree in Directed Graphs

**In-degree**: The number of edges pointing INTO a vertex.
- Notation: deg⁻(v)

**Out-degree**: The number of edges pointing OUT FROM a vertex.
- Notation: deg⁺(v)

**Total degree**: deg(v) = deg⁻(v) + deg⁺(v)

### Handshaking Theorem (Fundamental Property)

**Theorem**: In any graph, the sum of all vertex degrees equals twice the number of edges.

**Formula**: Σ deg(v) = 2|E|

**Why this works**: Each edge contributes 1 to the degree of each of its two endpoints, so it's counted twice in the sum.

**Corollary**: The sum of all degrees in any graph is always even.

## Special Types of Graphs

### Complete Graphs (Kₙ)

**Definition**: A simple graph where every pair of distinct vertices is connected by exactly one edge.

**Properties**:
- Kₙ has n vertices
- Kₙ has n(n-1)/2 edges
- Every vertex has degree n-1
- Examples: K₃ is a triangle, K₄ is a tetrahedron

### Cycle Graphs (Cₙ)

**Definition**: A simple graph with n vertices arranged in a cycle, where each vertex connects to exactly two others.

**Properties**:
- Cₙ has n vertices
- Cₙ has n edges
- Every vertex has degree 2
- Examples: C₃ is a triangle, C₄ is a square

**Definition**: A cycle Cₙ with an additional central vertex connected to all vertices in the cycle.

**Properties**:
- Wₙ has n+1 vertices
- Wₙ has 2n edges
- Central vertex has degree n
- Rim vertices have degree 3

### Complete Bipartite Graphs (Kₘ,ₙ)

**Definition**: A bipartite graph where every vertex in one set connects to every vertex in the other set.

**Properties**:
- Kₘ,ₙ has m+n vertices
- Kₘ,ₙ has mn edges
- Vertices in first set have degree n

## Bipartite Graphs

### Definition and Properties

**Bipartite Graph**: A graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets such that no two vertices within the same set are adjacent.

**Bipartition**: The division of vertices into two sets V₁ and V₂.

### Testing for Bipartiteness

**Theorem 4**: A graph is bipartite if and only if it can be colored with two colors such that no adjacent vertices have the same color.

**Algorithm**:
1. Start with any vertex and color it red
2. Color all its neighbors blue
3. Color all their neighbors red
4. Continue until all vertices are colored
5. If a contradiction arises, the graph is not bipartite

### Applications

**Matching Problems**: Bipartite graphs are ideal for modeling assignment problems:
- Employee-task assignments
- Student-course assignments
- Marriage matching problems

### Hall's Theorem (Marriage Theorem)

**Theorem**: In a bipartite graph G = (V₁ ∪ V₂, E), there exists a matching that covers every vertex in V₁ if and only if for every subset S ⊆ V₁, |N(S)| ≥ |S|.

**N(S)**: The neighborhood of S, i.e., all vertices in V₂ adjacent to at least one vertex in S.

## Graph Operations

### Subgraphs

**Subgraph**: A graph formed by taking a subset of vertices and edges from the original graph.

**Induced Subgraph**: A subgraph formed by taking a subset of vertices and ALL edges between those vertices from the original graph.

### Union of Graphs

**Definition**: G₁ ∪ G₂ has vertex set V₁ ∪ V₂ and edge set E₁ ∪ E₂.

### Complement of a Graph

**Definition**: The complement Ḡ of a simple graph G has the same vertex set, but vertices are adjacent in Ḡ if and only if they are NOT adjacent in G.

**Property**: G ∪ Ḡ = Kₙ (complete graph on n vertices)

### Graph Contraction

**Edge Contraction**: Removing an edge and merging its endpoints into a single vertex.

---

## Degree Sequences

### Definition

**Degree Sequence**: The sequence of vertex degrees arranged in non-increasing order.

### Graphic Sequences

**Graphic Sequence**: A sequence of non-negative integers that can be realized as the degree sequence of some simple graph.

### Properties

**Theorem**: If G is an n-regular graph with v vertices, then G has nv/2 edges.

- Total of m² processors

### Communication Complexity

**Theorem**: In a mesh network of n = m² processors, any two processors can communicate using O(√n) = O(m) hops.

### Exercise 4: Handshaking Theorem Verification

**Purpose**: Verify that Σ deg(v) = 2|E| for each graph

**Method**:
1. Sum all vertex degrees from previous exercises
2. Count total edges
3. Verify sum = 2 × (number of edges)
4. Explain why this relationship must hold

### Exercise 5: Existence of Simple Graphs

**Problem**: Can a simple graph exist with 15 vertices each of degree 5?

**Solution**:
- Total degree sum would be 15 × 5 = 75
- Since 75 is odd, this violates the handshaking theorem
- **Answer**: No such graph can exist

**Key Insight**: The sum of degrees must always be even

### Exercise 6: Handshaking at a Party

**Problem**: Show that the sum of handshakes is even

**Solution**:
- Model as a graph: people = vertices, handshakes = edges
- Each handshake involves exactly 2 people
- By handshaking theorem: sum of "handshakes per person" = 2 × (total handshakes)
- Therefore, the sum must be even

### Exercises 7-9: Directed Graphs

**Analysis Method**:
1. Count vertices and edges
2. For each vertex v, count:
   - In-degree: edges pointing to v
   - Out-degree: edges pointing from v
3. Verify: Σ in-degrees = Σ out-degrees = |E|

### Exercise 10: Directed Graph Degree Verification

**Theorem**: In any directed graph:
- Sum of all in-degrees = number of edges
- Sum of all out-degrees = number of edges

**Proof**: Each edge contributes exactly 1 to some vertex's in-degree and exactly 1 to some vertex's out-degree.

### Exercise 18: Pigeonhole Principle Application

**Theorem**: In a simple graph with at least 2 vertices, at least two vertices have the same degree.

**Proof**:
- In a simple graph with n vertices, possible degrees are 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1
- But a graph cannot simultaneously have a vertex of degree 0 and a vertex of degree n-1
- So there are at most n-1 possible degree values for n vertices
- By pigeonhole principle, at least two vertices must have the same degree

**Wₙ**: Never bipartite for n ≥ 3
- Contains the rim cycle Cₙ
- If n is odd, the rim cycle is odd, making the whole graph non-bipartite

**Qₙ**: Always bipartite
- Vertices can be partitioned by parity of bit strings
