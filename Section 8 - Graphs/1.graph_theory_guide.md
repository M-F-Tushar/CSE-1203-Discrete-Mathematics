# Complete Guide to Graphs and Graph Models

## 1. Fundamental Concepts

### 1.1 Basic Definition of a Graph

**Definition 1:** A graph G = (V, E) consists of:
- **V**: A nonempty set of vertices (also called nodes)
- **E**: A set of edges

**Key Properties:**
- Each edge has either one or two vertices associated with it, called its **endpoints**
- An edge is said to **connect** its endpoints
- Graphs can be finite (finite vertex and edge sets) or infinite (infinite vertex or edge sets)
- In most practical applications, we work with finite graphs

**Visual Representation:**
- Vertices are represented by points
- Edges are represented by line segments (which can be curved)
- The way we draw a graph is arbitrary as long as correct connections are shown
- Some graphs cannot be drawn without edges crossing

### 1.2 Types of Graphs

Understanding graphs requires answering three key questions:
1. Are the edges undirected or directed (or both)?
2. Are multiple edges present between the same vertices?
3. Are loops present?

#### Simple Graphs
- **Definition:** A graph where each edge connects two different vertices and no two edges connect the same pair of vertices
- **Characteristics:**
  - No loops (edges connecting a vertex to itself)
  - No multiple edges between the same pair of vertices
  - Each edge represents an unordered pair of vertices {u, v}

#### Multigraphs
- **Definition:** Graphs that may have multiple edges connecting the same vertices
- **Multiplicity:** When there are m different edges between vertices {u, v}, we say {u, v} is an edge of multiplicity m
- **Use Case:** Modeling networks with multiple connections between the same points

#### Pseudographs
- **Definition:** Graphs that may include loops and multiple edges
- **Loops:** Edges that connect a vertex to itself
- **Applications:** Modeling systems with self-referential connections

#### Directed Graphs (Digraphs)
- **Definition 2:** A directed graph (V, E) consists of vertices V and directed edges E
- **Directed Edges:** Each directed edge is associated with an ordered pair of vertices
- **Notation:** Edge from u to v is written as (u, v), starting at u and ending at v
- **Visual:** Represented with arrows showing direction

#### Simple Directed Graphs
- **Characteristics:**
  - No loops
  - No multiple directed edges
  - At most one edge for each ordered pair (u, v)

#### Directed Multigraphs
- **Definition:** Directed graphs that may have multiple directed edges between vertices
- **Multiplicity:** When there are m directed edges from u to v, (u, v) has multiplicity m

#### Mixed Graphs
- **Definition:** Graphs containing both directed and undirected edges
- **Applications:** Modeling systems with both bidirectional and unidirectional connections

### 1.3 Graph Terminology Summary
