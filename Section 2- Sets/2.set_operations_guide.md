# Complete Guide to Set Operations

## 2.2 Set Operations

### 2.2.1 Introduction

Set operations allow us to combine two or more sets in various ways. Starting with basic sets like mathematics majors and computer science majors at a school, we can create new sets representing students who are either type of major, both types, or neither.

## Basic Set Operations

### 1. Union of Sets

**Definition 1:** Let A and B be sets. The **union** of sets A and B, denoted by A ∪ B, is the set containing those elements that are either in A or in B, or in both.

**Formal Definition:** A ∪ B = {x | x ∈ A ∨ x ∈ B}

An element x belongs to A ∪ B if and only if x belongs to A OR x belongs to B.

**Example 1:** Union of {1, 3, 5} and {1, 2, 3}
- Solution: {1, 3, 5} ∪ {1, 2, 3} = {1, 2, 3, 5}
- Explanation: We include all elements that appear in either set. Note that 1 and 3 appear in both sets but are only listed once in the union.

**Example 2:** Real-world application
- The union of computer science majors and mathematics majors at a school is the set of all students majoring in either mathematics or computer science (or both).

### 2. Intersection of Sets

**Definition 2:** Let A and B be sets. The **intersection** of sets A and B, denoted by A ∩ B, is the set containing those elements that are in both A and B.

**Formal Definition:** A ∩ B = {x | x ∈ A ∧ x ∈ B}

**Example 3:** Intersection of {1, 3, 5} and {1, 2, 3}
- Solution: {1, 3, 5} ∩ {1, 2, 3} = {1, 3}
- Explanation: Only elements 1 and 3 appear in both sets.

**Example 4:** Real-world application
- The intersection of computer science majors and mathematics majors is the set of students who are joint majors in both subjects.

### 3. Disjoint Sets

**Definition 3:** Two sets are called **disjoint** if their intersection is the empty set.

**Example 5:** Disjoint sets
- Let A = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9} and B = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}
- Since A ∩ B = ∅, sets A and B are disjoint
- Explanation: No element appears in both sets.

### 4. Cardinality Formula for Union

For finite sets A and B:
**|A ∪ B| = |A| + |B| - |A ∩ B|**

This formula prevents double-counting elements that appear in both sets. Elements in A ∩ B are counted twice in |A| + |B|, so we subtract |A ∩ B| once.

### 5. Set Difference

**Definition 4:** Let A and B be sets. The **difference** of A and B, denoted by A - B, is the set containing those elements that are in A but not in B.

**Formal Definition:** A - B = {x | x ∈ A ∧ x ∉ B}

**Alternative Notation:** A \ B

**Example 6:** Set differences
- {1, 3, 5} - {1, 2, 3} = {5}
- {1, 2, 3} - {1, 3, 5} = {2}
- Explanation: Note that set difference is not commutative - order matters!

**Example 7:** Real-world application
- Computer science majors minus mathematics majors = computer science majors who are not also mathematics majors.

### 6. Set Complement

**Definition 5:** Let U be the universal set. The **complement** of set A, denoted by Ā, is the complement of A with respect to U. Therefore, Ā = U - A.

**Formal Definition:** Ā = {x ∈ U | x ∉ A}

**Example 8:** Complement with alphabet
- Let A = {a, e, i, o, u} (vowels in English alphabet)
- Then Ā = {b, c, d, f, g, h, j, k, l, m, n, p, q, r, s, t, v, w, x, y, z}
- Explanation: The complement contains all letters except the vowels.

**Example 9:** Complement with positive integers
- Let A = positive integers greater than 10 (Universal set = all positive integers)
- Then Ā = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}
- Explanation: The complement contains all positive integers not greater than 10.

**Important Relationship:** A - B = A ∩ B̄
This shows that set difference can be expressed using intersection and complement.

## 2.2.2 Set Identities

Set identities are fundamental laws that govern set operations. These are analogous to logical equivalences.

### Table of Set Identities

| Identity | Name |
|----------|------|
| A ∩ U = A, A ∪ ∅ = A | Identity laws |
| A ∪ U = U, A ∩ ∅ = ∅ | Domination laws |
| A ∪ A = A, A ∩ A = A | Idempotent laws |
| (Ā) = A | Complementation law |
| A ∪ B = B ∪ A, A ∩ B = B ∩ A | Commutative laws |
| A ∪ (B ∪ C) = (A ∪ B) ∪ C, A ∩ (B ∩ C) = (A ∩ B) ∩ C | Associative laws |
| A ∪ (B ∩ C) = (A ∪ B) ∩ (A ∪ C), A ∩ (B ∪ C) = (A ∩ B) ∪ (A ∩ C) | Distributive laws |
| A ∩ B = Ā ∪ B̄, A ∪ B = Ā ∩ B̄ | De Morgan's laws |
| A ∪ (A ∩ B) = A, A ∩ (A ∪ B) = A | Absorption laws |
| A ∪ Ā = U, A ∩ Ā = ∅ | Complement laws |

### Methods for Proving Set Identities

#### Method 1: Subset Method

**Example 10:** Prove De Morgan's Law: A ∩ B = Ā ∪ B̄

**Proof:**
We prove equality by showing each set is a subset of the other.

**Part 1:** Show A ∩ B ⊆ Ā ∪ B̄
- Let x ∈ A ∩ B
- By definition of complement: x ∉ A ∩ B
- By definition of intersection: ¬(x ∈ A ∧ x ∈ B)
- By De Morgan's law for propositions: ¬(x ∈ A) ∨ ¬(x ∈ B)
- This means: x ∉ A or x ∉ B
- By definition of complement: x ∈ Ā or x ∈ B̄
- By definition of union: x ∈ Ā ∪ B̄

**Part 2:** Show Ā ∪ B̄ ⊆ A ∩ B
- Let x ∈ Ā ∪ B̄
- By definition of union: x ∈ Ā or x ∈ B̄
- By definition of complement: x ∉ A or x ∉ B
- This means: ¬(x ∈ A) ∨ ¬(x ∈ B)
- By De Morgan's law for propositions: ¬(x ∈ A ∧ x ∈ B)
- By definition of intersection: ¬(x ∈ A ∩ B)
- By definition of complement: x ∈ A ∩ B

Therefore, A ∩ B = Ā ∪ B̄. ∎

#### Method 2: Set Builder Notation

**Example 11:** Alternative proof of De Morgan's Law using set builder notation

**Proof:**
A ∩ B = {x | x ∉ A ∩ B}  (by definition of complement)
= {x | ¬(x ∈ A ∩ B)}  (by definition of ∉)
= {x | ¬(x ∈ A ∧ x ∈ B)}  (by definition of intersection)
= {x | ¬(x ∈ A) ∨ ¬(x ∈ B)}  (by De Morgan's law for logic)
= {x | x ∉ A ∨ x ∉ B}  (by definition of ∉)
= {x | x ∈ Ā ∨ x ∈ B̄}  (by definition of complement)
= {x | x ∈ Ā ∪ B̄}  (by definition of union)
= Ā ∪ B̄  (by set builder notation) ∎

#### Method 3: Membership Tables

**Example 13:** Prove A ∩ (B ∪ C) = (A ∩ B) ∪ (A ∩ C) using membership tables

| A | B | C | B ∪ C | A ∩ (B ∪ C) | A ∩ B | A ∩ C | (A ∩ B) ∪ (A ∩ C) |
|---|---|---|-------|-------------|-------|-------|-------------------|
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1     | 1           | 1     | 1     | 1                 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 1     | 1           | 1     | 0     | 1                 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 1     | 1           | 0     | 1     | 1                 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 0     | 0           | 0     | 0     | 0                 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 1     | 0           | 0     | 0     | 0                 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 1     | 0           | 0     | 0     | 0                 |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 1     | 0           | 0     | 0     | 0                 |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0     | 0           | 0     | 0     | 0                 |

Since columns 5 and 8 are identical, the identity is proven. ∎

#### Method 4: Using Established Identities

**Example 14:** Prove A ∪ (B ∩ C) = (C ∪ B) ∩ A using established identities

**Proof:**
A ∪ (B ∩ C) = A ∩ (B ∩ C)  (by first De Morgan law)
= A ∩ (B̄ ∪ C̄)  (by second De Morgan law)
= (B̄ ∪ C̄) ∩ A  (by commutative law for intersections)
= (C̄ ∪ B̄) ∩ A  (by commutative law for unions) ∎

## 2.2.3 Generalized Unions and Intersections

### Multiple Set Operations

Due to associative laws, expressions like A ∪ B ∪ C and A ∩ B ∩ C are unambiguous.

- **A ∪ B ∪ C**: Contains elements in at least one of A, B, or C
- **A ∩ B ∩ C**: Contains elements in all of A, B, and C

**Example 15:** Multiple set operations
- Let A = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8}, B = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}, C = {0, 3, 6, 9}
- A ∪ B ∪ C = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9} (all elements appearing in any set)
- A ∩ B ∩ C = {0} (only element appearing in all three sets)

### General Notation

**Definition 6:** Union of a collection of sets
A₁ ∪ A₂ ∪ ⋯ ∪ Aₙ = ⋃ᵢ₌₁ⁿ Aᵢ

**Definition 7:** Intersection of a collection of sets
A₁ ∩ A₂ ∩ ⋯ ∩ Aₙ = ⋂ᵢ₌₁ⁿ Aᵢ

**Example 16:** Infinite sequences of sets
- For i = 1, 2, ..., let Aᵢ = {i, i+1, i+2, ...}
- ⋃ᵢ₌₁ⁿ Aᵢ = {1, 2, 3, ...} (all positive integers)
- ⋂ᵢ₌₁ⁿ Aᵢ = {n, n+1, n+2, ...} = Aₙ (elements ≥ n)

**Example 17:** Another infinite example
- Let Aᵢ = {1, 2, 3, ..., i} for i = 1, 2, 3, ...
- ⋃ᵢ₌₁^∞ Aᵢ = {1, 2, 3, ...} = Z⁺ (all positive integers)
- ⋂ᵢ₌₁^∞ Aᵢ = {1} (only 1 is in every set)

### General Index Sets

For any index set I:
- ⋂ᵢ∈I Aᵢ = {x | ∀i ∈ I (x ∈ Aᵢ)}
- ⋃ᵢ∈I Aᵢ = {x | ∃i ∈ I (x ∈ Aᵢ)}

## 2.2.4 Computer Representation of Sets

### Bit String Representation

For a finite universal set U with ordered elements a₁, a₂, ..., aₙ, represent any subset A with a bit string of length n where:
- Bit i = 1 if aᵢ ∈ A
- Bit i = 0 if aᵢ ∉ A

**Example 18:** Bit string representation
- U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10} (ordered increasingly)

**Sets and their bit strings:**
- Odd integers {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}: **1010101010**
- Even integers {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}: **0101010101**  
- Integers ≤ 5 {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}: **1111100000**

### Set Operations with Bit Strings

**Complement:** Flip each bit (0→1, 1→0)

**Example 19:** Finding complement
- Set {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}: 1010101010
- Complement: 0101010101 = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}

**Union:** Bitwise OR operation
**Intersection:** Bitwise AND operation

**Example 20:** Union and intersection using bit strings
- Set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}: 1111100000
- Set {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}: 1010101010

**Union:**
1111100000 ∨ 1010101010 = 1111101010 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}

**Intersection:**
1111100000 ∧ 1010101010 = 1010100000 = {1, 3, 5}

## 2.2.5 Multisets

### Definition and Notation

A **multiset** is an unordered collection where elements can occur multiple times.

**Notations:**
1. List elements with repetition: {a, a, a, b, b}
2. Multiplicity notation: {3·a, 2·b}

**Cardinality:** Sum of all multiplicities

### Multiset Operations

For multisets P and Q with elements having multiplicities mₚ(x) and m_Q(x):

- **Union:** mₚ∪Q(x) = max(mₚ(x), m_Q(x))
- **Intersection:** mₚ∩Q(x) = min(mₚ(x), m_Q(x))  
- **Difference:** mₚ₋Q(x) = max(mₚ(x) - m_Q(x), 0)
- **Sum:** mₚ₊Q(x) = mₚ(x) + m_Q(x)

**Example 21:** Multiset operations
- P = {4·a, 1·b, 3·c}
- Q = {3·a, 4·b, 2·d}

**Solutions:**
- **P ∪ Q = {4·a, 4·b, 3·c, 2·d}**
  - For a: max(4,3) = 4
  - For b: max(1,4) = 4  
  - For c: max(3,0) = 3
  - For d: max(0,2) = 2

- **P ∩ Q = {3·a, 1·b}**
  - For a: min(4,3) = 3
  - For b: min(1,4) = 1
  - For c: min(3,0) = 0 (excluded)
  - For d: min(0,2) = 0 (excluded)

- **P - Q = {1·a, 3·c}**
  - For a: max(4-3,0) = 1
  - For b: max(1-4,0) = 0 (excluded)
  - For c: max(3-0,0) = 3
  - For d: max(0-2,0) = 0 (excluded)

- **P + Q = {7·a, 5·b, 3·c, 2·d}**
  - For a: 4+3 = 7
  - For b: 1+4 = 5
  - For c: 3+0 = 3
  - For d: 0+2 = 2
