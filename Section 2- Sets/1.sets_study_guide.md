# Complete Study Guide: Sets - Discrete Mathematics

## 2.1 Sets

### 2.1.1 Introduction

Sets are the fundamental discrete structure upon which all other discrete structures are built. They are used to group objects together, often (but not always) objects with similar properties.

**Examples of sets in everyday context:**
- All students currently enrolled in your school
- All students taking discrete mathematics at any school
- Students enrolled in your school AND taking discrete mathematics (intersection of the first two)

## Fundamental Definitions

### Definition 1: Set
A **set** is an unordered collection of distinct objects, called **elements** or **members** of the set.

**Notation:**
- `a ∈ A` means "a is an element of set A"
- `a ∉ A` means "a is not an element of set A"
- Sets are typically denoted with uppercase letters
- Elements are typically denoted with lowercase letters

## Ways to Describe Sets

### 1. Roster Method
List all members between braces: `{a, b, c, d}`

**Example 1:** The set V of all vowels in the English alphabet
```
V = {a, e, i, o, u}
```

**Example 2:** The set O of odd positive integers less than 10
```
O = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}
```

**Example 3:** Sets can contain seemingly unrelated elements
```
{a, 2, Fred, New Jersey}
```

**Example 4:** Using ellipses for obvious patterns
```
{1, 2, 3, ..., 99} (positive integers less than 100)
```

### 2. Set Builder Notation
Format: `{x | x has property P}` (read as "the set of all x such that x has property P")

**Examples:**
- `O = {x | x is an odd positive integer less than 10}`
- `O = {x ∈ Z⁺ | x is odd and x < 10}` (specifying the universe)
- `Q⁺ = {x ∈ R | x = p/q, for some positive integers p and q}`

## Standard Mathematical Sets

| Symbol | Set | Description |
|--------|-----|-------------|
| **N** | `{0, 1, 2, 3, ...}` | Natural numbers |
| **Z** | `{..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...}` | Integers |
| **Z⁺** | `{1, 2, 3, ...}` | Positive integers |
| **Q** | `{p/q | p ∈ Z, q ∈ Z, q ≠ 0}` | Rational numbers |
| **R** | All real numbers | Real numbers |
| **R⁺** | All positive real numbers | Positive real numbers |
| **C** | All complex numbers | Complex numbers |

**Note:** Some mathematicians don't consider 0 a natural number - always check context!

## Intervals (Subsets of Real Numbers)

For real numbers a and b where a ≤ b:

| Notation | Description | Set Builder Form |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| **[a, b]** | Closed interval | `{x | a ≤ x ≤ b}` |
| **[a, b)** | Half-open interval | `{x | a ≤ x < b}` |
| **(a, b]** | Half-open interval | `{x | a < x ≤ b}` |
| **(a, b)** | Open interval | `{x | a < x < b}` |

**Example 5:** Sets can have other sets as members
```
{N, Z, Q, R} is a set with four elements, each of which is itself a set
```

---

## Set Equality

### Definition 2: Set Equality
Two sets are equal if and only if they have the same elements.

**Formal definition:** A = B if and only if ∀x(x ∈ A ↔ x ∈ B)

**Example 6:** Understanding set equality
- `{1, 3, 5}` and `{3, 5, 1}` are equal (order doesn't matter)
- `{1, 3, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 5}` equals `{1, 3, 5}` (repetition doesn't matter)

---

## Special Sets

### The Empty Set
- **Symbol:** ∅ or { }
- **Definition:** The set with no elements
- **Example:** The set of positive integers greater than their squares is ∅

### Singleton Sets
- **Definition:** A set with exactly one element
- **Important distinction:** ∅ ≠ {∅}
  - ∅ is the empty set
  - {∅} is a set containing one element (the empty set itself)
- **Analogy:** Think of computer folders - ∅ is an empty folder, {∅} is a folder containing one empty folder

## 2.1.2 Venn Diagrams

**Named after:** John Venn (English mathematician, 1881)

**Components:**
- Rectangle represents the universal set U
- Circles represent individual sets
- Points can represent specific elements

**Example 7:** Venn diagram for vowels
- Rectangle U = set of 26 letters in English alphabet  
- Circle V inside rectangle = set of vowels {a, e, i, o, u}
- Points inside circle V = individual vowels

## 2.1.3 Subsets

### Definition 3: Subset
Set A is a **subset** of B (A ⊆ B) if every element of A is also an element of B.
Set B is a **superset** of A (B ⊇ A).

**Formal definition:** A ⊆ B if and only if ∀x(x ∈ A → x ∈ B)

### Rules for Proving Subsets

**To show A ⊆ B:** Show that if x belongs to A, then x also belongs to B

**To show A ⊈ B:** Find a single element x ∈ A such that x ∉ B (counterexample)

**Example 8:** Valid subset relationships
- Odd positive integers < 10 ⊆ positive integers < 10
- Rational numbers ⊆ real numbers  
- Computer science majors at your school ⊆ all students at your school
- People in China ⊆ people in China (every set is a subset of itself)

**Example 9:** Invalid subset relationships
- Integers with squares < 100 ⊄ nonnegative integers (because -1 is in the first set but not the second)

### Theorem 1: Universal Subset Properties
For every set S:
1. ∅ ⊆ S (empty set is subset of every set)
2. S ⊆ S (every set is subset of itself)

**Proof of (i):** To show ∅ ⊆ S, we must prove ∀x(x ∈ ∅ → x ∈ S). Since ∅ contains no elements, x ∈ ∅ is always false. A conditional statement with false hypothesis is always true, so the statement is true. (This is a **vacuous proof**.)

### Proper Subsets
**Notation:** A ⊂ B (A is a proper subset of B)
**Definition:** A ⊂ B means A ⊆ B AND A ≠ B

**Formal definition:** A ⊂ B if and only if:
∀x(x ∈ A → x ∈ B) ∧ ∃x(x ∈ B ∧ x ∉ A)

### Proving Set Equality
**Method:** To show A = B, prove both A ⊆ B and B ⊆ A

This works because A = B if and only if ∀x(x ∈ A ↔ x ∈ B)

## 2.1.4 The Size of a Set

### Definition 4: Cardinality
If set S has exactly n distinct elements (n is a nonnegative integer), then S is **finite** and n is the **cardinality** of S.

**Notation:** |S| = n

**Example 10:** |{1, 3, 5, 7, 9}| = 5

**Example 11:** |{letters in English alphabet}| = 26  

**Example 12:** |∅| = 0

### Definition 5: Infinite Sets
A set is **infinite** if it is not finite.

**Example 13:** The set of positive integers Z⁺ is infinite

---

## 2.1.5 Power Sets

### Definition 6: Power Set
The **power set** of S, denoted P(S), is the set of all subsets of S.

**Example 14:** Find P({0, 1, 2})

**Solution:**
```
P({0, 1, 2}) = {∅, {0}, {1}, {2}, {0,1}, {0,2}, {1,2}, {0,1,2}}
```

**Analysis:** 
- Subsets with 0 elements: ∅
- Subsets with 1 element: {0}, {1}, {2}  
- Subsets with 2 elements: {0,1}, {0,2}, {1,2}
- Subsets with 3 elements: {0,1,2}
- Total: 8 = 2³ subsets

**Example 15:** Power sets of special cases

**For ∅:**
```
P(∅) = {∅}
```
(The empty set has one subset: itself)

**For {∅}:**
```
P({∅}) = {∅, {∅}}
```
(The set {∅} has two subsets: ∅ and {∅})

### Key Property
If a set has n elements, its power set has 2ⁿ elements.

## 2.1.6 Cartesian Products

### Definition 7: Ordered n-tuple
An **ordered n-tuple** (a₁, a₂, ..., aₙ) is an ordered collection with:
- a₁ as first element
- a₂ as second element  
- aₙ as nth element

**Equality:** (a₁, a₂, ..., aₙ) = (b₁, b₂, ..., bₙ) if and only if aᵢ = bᵢ for i = 1, 2, ..., n

**Ordered pairs:** Special case where n = 2
- (a, b) = (c, d) if and only if a = c and b = d
- Note: (a, b) ≠ (b, a) unless a = b

### Definition 8: Cartesian Product (Two Sets)
For sets A and B, the **Cartesian product** A × B is:
```
A × B = {(a, b) | a ∈ A ∧ b ∈ B}
```

**Example 16:** Students and Courses
- A = set of all students at university
- B = set of all courses offered  
- A × B = all possible student-course pairs
- Each subset of A × B represents a possible enrollment configuration
- P(A × B) represents all possible enrollment configurations

**Example 17:** A = {1, 2}, B = {a, b, c}
```
A × B = {(1,a), (1,b), (1,c), (2,a), (2,b), (2,c)}
```

**Example 18:** Cartesian products are not commutative
```
B × A = {(a,1), (a,2), (b,1), (b,2), (c,1), (c,2)}
```
Note: A × B ≠ B × A (unless A = ∅ or B = ∅ or A = B)

### Definition 9: Cartesian Product (Multiple Sets)
```
A₁ × A₂ × ... × Aₙ = {(a₁, a₂, ..., aₙ) | aᵢ ∈ Aᵢ for i = 1, 2, ..., n}
```

**Example 19:** A = {0, 1}, B = {1, 2}, C = {0, 1, 2}
```
A × B × C = {(0,1,0), (0,1,1), (0,1,2), (0,2,0), (0,2,1), (0,2,2),
             (1,1,0), (1,1,1), (1,1,2), (1,2,0), (1,2,1), (1,2,2)}
```

### Powers of Sets
**Notation:** 
- A² = A × A
- A³ = A × A × A  
- Aⁿ = {(a₁, a₂, ..., aₙ) | aᵢ ∈ A for i = 1, 2, ..., n}

**Example 20:** A = {1, 2}
```
A² = {(1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)}
A³ = {(1,1,1), (1,1,2), (1,2,1), (1,2,2), (2,1,1), (2,1,2), (2,2,1), (2,2,2)}
```

### Relations
A **relation** from set A to set B is a subset R of A × B.
A **relation on A** is a relation from A to itself.

**Example 21:** Less than or equal relation on {0, 1, 2, 3}
```
R = {(0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3)}
```

## 2.1.7 Using Set Notation with Quantifiers

### Restricted Quantification
- `∀x ∈ S(P(x))` is shorthand for `∀x(x ∈ S → P(x))`
- `∃x ∈ S(P(x))` is shorthand for `∃x(x ∈ S ∧ P(x))`

**Example 22:** 
- `∀x ∈ R(x² ≥ 0)` means "For every real number x, x² ≥ 0" (TRUE)
- `∃x ∈ Z(x² = 1)` means "There exists an integer x such that x² = 1" (TRUE, since x = ±1)

---

## 2.1.8 Truth Sets and Quantifiers

### Definition: Truth Set
For predicate P and domain D, the **truth set** of P is:
```
{x ∈ D | P(x)}
```
(the set of all elements x in D for which P(x) is true)

**Example 23:** Domain = integers
- P(x): "|x| = 1" → Truth set = {-1, 1}  
- Q(x): "x² = 2" → Truth set = ∅ (no integers satisfy this)
- R(x): "|x| = x" → Truth set = N (nonnegative integers)

### Connection to Quantifiers
- `∀xP(x)` is true over domain U ⟺ truth set of P equals U
- `∃xP(x)` is true over domain U ⟺ truth set of P is nonempty
