# Nested Quantifiers - Complete Study Guide

## 1.5.1 Introduction

**Definition**: Nested quantifiers occur when one quantifier is within the scope of another quantifier.

**Example**: ∀x∃y(x + y = 0)

**Key Insight**: Everything within the scope of a quantifier can be thought of as a propositional function.
- ∀x∃y(x + y = 0) is the same as ∀xQ(x)
- Where Q(x) is ∃yP(x, y)
- Where P(x, y) is x + y = 0

**Applications**: Nested quantifiers are essential for:
- Mathematical statements like "The sum of two positive integers is always positive"
- English sentences like "Everyone has exactly one best friend"
- Negating complex logical statements

## 1.5.2 Understanding Statements Involving Nested Quantifiers

### Example 1: Basic Mathematical Laws
**Domain**: All real numbers

1. **∀x∀y(x + y = y + x)**
   - **Meaning**: For all real numbers x and y, x + y = y + x
   - **Mathematical Law**: Commutative law for addition

2. **∀x∃y(x + y = 0)**
   - **Meaning**: For every real number x, there exists a real number y such that x + y = 0
   - **Mathematical Law**: Every real number has an additive inverse

3. **∀x∀y∀z(x + (y + z) = (x + y) + z)**
   - **Meaning**: Associative law for addition of real numbers

### Example 2: Translation to English
**Statement**: ∀x∀y((x > 0) ∧ (y < 0) → (xy < 0))
**Domain**: All real numbers

**Step-by-step translation**:
1. For every real number x and for every real number y
2. If x > 0 and y < 0
3. Then xy < 0

**Final English**: "The product of a positive real number and a negative real number is always a negative real number."

### Thinking of Quantification as Loops

**For ∀x∀yP(x, y)**:
- Loop through all values of x
- For each x, loop through all values of y
- If P(x, y) is true for all combinations → statement is true
- If any P(x, y) is false → statement is false

**For ∀x∃yP(x, y)**:
- Loop through all values of x
- For each x, loop through values of y until finding one where P(x, y) is true
- If we find such a y for every x → statement is true
- If any x has no such y → statement is false

**For ∃x∀yP(x, y)**:
- Loop through values of x until finding one where P(x, y) is always true for all y
- If we find such an x → statement is true
- If no such x exists → statement is false

**For ∃x∃yP(x, y)**:
- Loop through values of x
- For each x, loop through values of y until finding P(x, y) true
- If we find any such pair (x, y) → statement is true
- If no such pair exists → statement is false

## 1.5.3 The Order of Quantifiers

### Example 3: Universal Quantifiers Order
**P(x, y)**: "x + y = y + x"
**Domain**: All real numbers

**∀x∀yP(x, y)**: "For all real numbers x, for all real numbers y, x + y = y + x"
**∀y∀xP(x, y)**: "For all real numbers y, for all real numbers x, x + y = y + x"

**Result**: Both statements are **true** and have the **same meaning**.

**Principle**: The order of nested universal quantifiers can be changed without changing the meaning.

### Example 4: Mixed Quantifiers Order (Critical!)
**Q(x, y)**: "x + y = 0"
**Domain**: All real numbers

**∃y∀xQ(x, y)**: 
- **Meaning**: "There is a real number y such that for every real number x, x + y = 0"
- **Analysis**: No matter what y we choose, x + y = 0 only works for one specific x
- **Truth Value**: **FALSE**

**∀x∃yQ(x, y)**:
- **Meaning**: "For every real number x there is a real number y such that x + y = 0"
- **Analysis**: Given any x, we can choose y = -x to make x + y = 0
- **Truth Value**: **TRUE**

**Key Insight**: 
- In ∃y∀xP(x, y): y must be a **constant** that works for all x
- In ∀x∃yP(x, y): y can **depend on** the choice of x

**Important Relationship**: If ∃y∀xP(x, y) is true, then ∀x∃yP(x, y) must also be true. However, the converse is not necessarily true.

### Summary Table: Quantifications of Two Variables

| Statement | When True? | When False? |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| ∀x∀yP(x, y) | P(x, y) is true for every pair x, y | There is a pair x, y for which P(x, y) is false |
| ∀y∀xP(x, y) | Same as above | Same as above |
| ∀x∃yP(x, y) | For every x there is a y for which P(x, y) is true | There is an x such that P(x, y) is false for every y |
| ∃x∀yP(x, y) | There is an x for which P(x, y) is true for every y | For every x there is a y for which P(x, y) is false |
| ∃x∃yP(x, y) | There is a pair x, y for which P(x, y) is true | P(x, y) is false for every pair x, y |
| ∃y∃xP(x, y) | Same as above | Same as above |

### Example 5: Three Variables
**Q(x, y, z)**: "x + y = z"
**Domain**: All real numbers

**∀x∀y∃zQ(x, y, z)**:
- **Meaning**: "For all real numbers x and y, there exists a real number z such that x + y = z"
- **Analysis**: Given any x and y, we can always find z = x + y
- **Truth Value**: **TRUE**

**∃z∀x∀yQ(x, y, z)**:
- **Meaning**: "There exists a real number z such that for all real numbers x and y, x + y = z"
- **Analysis**: No single z can equal x + y for all possible x and y
- **Truth Value**: **FALSE**

## 1.5.4 Translating Mathematical Statements into Logical Expressions

### Example 6: Sum of Positive Integers
**Statement**: "The sum of two positive integers is always positive"

**Translation Process**:
1. Rewrite with explicit quantifiers: "For every two integers, if these integers are both positive, then the sum of these integers is positive"
2. Introduce variables: "For all positive integers x and y, x + y is positive"
3. **Logical Expression**: ∀x∀y((x > 0) ∧ (y > 0) → (x + y > 0))
   - Domain: all integers

**Alternative approach** (restricting domain):
- **Logical Expression**: ∀x∀y(x + y > 0)
- Domain: all positive integers

### Example 7: Multiplicative Inverse
**Statement**: "Every real number except zero has a multiplicative inverse"
**Definition**: A multiplicative inverse of x is a real number y such that xy = 1

**Translation Process**:
1. "For every real number x except zero, x has a multiplicative inverse"
2. "For every real number x, if x ≠ 0, then there exists a real number y such that xy = 1"
3. **Logical Expression**: ∀x((x ≠ 0) → ∃y(xy = 1))

### Example 8: Calculus Limit Definition
**Statement**: lim[x→a] f(x) = L

**Mathematical Definition**: For every real number ε > 0 there exists a real number δ > 0 such that |f(x) - L| < ε whenever 0 < |x - a| < δ

**Logical Expression**: ∀ε∃δ∀x(0 < |x - a| < δ → |f(x) - L| < ε)
- Domain for δ and ε: all positive real numbers
- Domain for x: all real numbers

**Alternative with restricted quantifiers**:
∀ε>0 ∃δ>0 ∀x(0 < |x - a| < δ → |f(x) - L| < ε)

## 1.5.5 Translating from Nested Quantifiers into English

### Example 9: Students and Computers
**Statement**: ∀x(C(x) ∨ ∃y(C(y) ∧ F(x, y)))
**Predicates**: 
- C(x): "x has a computer"
- F(x, y): "x and y are friends"
**Domain**: All students in your school

**Translation Process**:
1. For every student x: x has a computer OR there exists a student y such that (y has a computer AND x and y are friends)
2. **English**: "Every student in your school has a computer or has a friend who has a computer"

### Example 10: Friends Relationships
**Statement**: ∃x∀y∀z((F(x, y) ∧ F(x, z) ∧ (y ≠ z)) → ¬F(y, z))
**Predicate**: F(a, b): "a and b are friends"
**Domain**: All students in your school

**Translation Process**:
1. Analyze inner expression: (F(x, y) ∧ F(x, z) ∧ (y ≠ z)) → ¬F(y, z)
   - "If x and y are friends, and x and z are friends, and y ≠ z, then y and z are not friends"
2. Full statement: "There exists a student x such that for all students y and z (y ≠ z), if x is friends with both y and z, then y and z are not friends"
3. **English**: "There is a student none of whose friends are also friends with each other"

---

## 1.5.6 Translating English Sentences into Logical Expressions

### Example 11: Mother Relationship
**Statement**: "If a person is female and is a parent, then this person is someone's mother"

**Translation Process**:
1. "For every person x, if person x is female and person x is a parent, then there exists a person y such that person x is the mother of person y"
2. **Predicates**:
   - F(x): "x is female"
   - P(x): "x is a parent"
   - M(x, y): "x is the mother of y"
3. **Logical Expression**: ∀x((F(x) ∧ P(x)) → ∃yM(x, y))

**Equivalent form** (using null quantification rule):
∀x∃y((F(x) ∧ P(x)) → M(x, y))

### Example 12: Best Friend
**Statement**: "Everyone has exactly one best friend"

**Translation Process**:
1. "For every person x, person x has exactly one best friend"
2. "Exactly one" means: there exists someone who is the best friend AND for everyone else, they are not the best friend
3. **Predicate**: B(x, y): "y is the best friend of x"
4. "x has exactly one best friend": ∃y(B(x, y) ∧ ∀z((z ≠ y) → ¬B(x, z)))
5. **Final Expression**: ∀x∃y(B(x, y) ∧ ∀z((z ≠ y) → ¬B(x, z)))

**Alternative notation**: ∀x∃!yB(x, y) (using uniqueness quantifier ∃!)

### Example 13: Woman and Airlines
**Statement**: "There is a woman who has taken a flight on every airline in the world"

**Predicates**:
- P(w, f): "w has taken f"
- Q(f, a): "f is a flight on a"

**Logical Expression**: ∃w∀a∃f(P(w, f) ∧ Q(f, a))

**Domains**:
- w: all women in the world
- f: all airplane flights
- a: all airlines

**Alternative (more compact but less clear)**:
∃w∀a∃fR(w, f, a) where R(w, f, a): "w has taken f on a"

## 1.5.7 Negating Nested Quantifiers

### De Morgan's Laws for Quantifiers (Review)
- ¬∀xP(x) ≡ ∃x¬P(x)
- ¬∃xP(x) ≡ ∀x¬P(x)

### Example 14: Basic Negation
**Statement**: ∀x∃y(xy = 1)
**Negation**: ¬∀x∃y(xy = 1)

**Step-by-step process**:
1. ¬∀x∃y(xy = 1) ≡ ∃x¬∃y(xy = 1)
2. ≡ ∃x∀y¬(xy = 1)
3. ≡ ∃x∀y(xy ≠ 1)

**Result**: ∃x∀y(xy ≠ 1)
**Meaning**: "There exists an x such that for all y, xy ≠ 1"

### Example 15: Woman and Airlines Negation
**Original Statement**: "There is a woman who has taken a flight on every airline in the world"
**Negation**: "There does not exist a woman who has taken a flight on every airline in the world"

**From Example 13**: ∃w∀a∃f(P(w, f) ∧ Q(f, a))
**Negated**: ¬∃w∀a∃f(P(w, f) ∧ Q(f, a))

**Step-by-step process**:
1. ¬∃w∀a∃f(P(w, f) ∧ Q(f, a))
2. ≡ ∀w¬∀a∃f(P(w, f) ∧ Q(f, a))
3. ≡ ∀w∃a¬∃f(P(w, f) ∧ Q(f, a))
4. ≡ ∀w∃a∀f¬(P(w, f) ∧ Q(f, a))
5. ≡ ∀w∃a∀f(¬P(w, f) ∨ ¬Q(f, a))  [De Morgan's law for conjunction]

**Final Result**: ∀w∃a∀f(¬P(w, f) ∨ ¬Q(f, a))
**Meaning**: "For every woman there is an airline such that for all flights, this woman has not taken that flight or that flight is not on this airline"

### Example 16: Limit Does Not Exist (Calculus)
**Statement**: lim[x→a] f(x) does not exist

**From Example 8, the limit exists means**:
∀ε>0 ∃δ>0 ∀x(0 < |x - a| < δ → |f(x) - L| < ε)

**Limit ≠ L means**:
¬∀ε>0 ∃δ>0 ∀x(0 < |x - a| < δ → |f(x) - L| < ε)

**Step-by-step negation**:
1. ¬∀ε>0 ∃δ>0 ∀x(0 < |x - a| < δ → |f(x) - L| < ε)
2. ≡ ∃ε>0 ¬∃δ>0 ∀x(0 < |x - a| < δ → |f(x) - L| < ε)
3. ≡ ∃ε>0 ∀δ>0 ¬∀x(0 < |x - a| < δ → |f(x) - L| < ε)
4. ≡ ∃ε>0 ∀δ>0 ∃x ¬(0 < |x - a| < δ → |f(x) - L| < ε)
5. ≡ ∃ε>0 ∀δ>0 ∃x(0 < |x - a| < δ ∧ |f(x) - L| ≥ ε)  [Using ¬(p → q) ≡ p ∧ ¬q]

**Limit does not exist** (for all L):
∀L∃ε>0 ∀δ>0 ∃x(0 < |x - a| < δ ∧ |f(x) - L| ≥ ε)

**Final Meaning**: "For every real number L there is a real number ε > 0 such that for every real number δ > 0, there exists a real number x such that 0 < |x - a| < δ and |f(x) - L| ≥ ε"
