# Propositional Logic - Complete Study Guide

## 1.1 Introduction to Propositional Logic

### What is Propositional Logic?
Propositional logic provides precise meaning to mathematical statements and distinguishes between valid and invalid arguments. It's fundamental to:
- Mathematical reasoning
- Computer circuit design
- Program construction and verification
- Automated proof systems

## 1.2 Propositions

### Definition
A **proposition** is a declarative sentence that is either true or false, but not both.

### Example 1: Valid Propositions
1. "Washington, D.C., is the capital of the United States of America." → **TRUE**
2. "Toronto is the capital of Canada." → **FALSE** (Ottawa is the capital)
3. "1 + 1 = 2." → **TRUE**
4. "2 + 2 = 3." → **FALSE**

### Example 2: Non-Propositions
1. "What time is it?" → **Not a proposition** (question, not declarative)
2. "Read this carefully." → **Not a proposition** (command, not declarative)
3. "x + 1 = 2." → **Not a proposition** (contains variable, truth value depends on x)
4. "x + y = z." → **Not a proposition** (contains variables, truth value depends on x, y, z)

### Key Concepts
- **Propositional variables**: Letters (p, q, r, s, ...) representing propositions
- **Truth values**: T (true) or F (false)
- **Atomic propositions**: Cannot be expressed in terms of simpler propositions

## 1.3 Logical Operators (Connectives)

### 1.3.1 Negation (¬)

**Definition**: The negation of p, denoted ¬p, is "It is not the case that p."

**Truth Table**:
| p | ¬p |
|---|----| 
| T | F  |
| F | T  |

#### Example 3: Negation Practice
**Given**: "Michael's PC runs Linux"
**Negation**: "It is not the case that Michael's PC runs Linux"
**Simplified**: "Michael's PC does not run Linux"

#### Example 4: Negation with Quantifiers
**Given**: "Vandana's smartphone has at least 32 GB of memory"
**Negation**: "It is not the case that Vandana's smartphone has at least 32 GB of memory"
**Simplified**: "Vandana's smartphone has less than 32 GB of memory"

### 1.3.2 Conjunction (∧)

**Definition**: The conjunction of p and q, denoted p ∧ q, is "p and q." True only when both p and q are true.

**Truth Table**:
| p | q | p ∧ q |
|---|---|-------|
| T | T |   T   |
| T | F |   F   |
| F | T |   F   |
| F | F |   F   |

#### Example 5: Conjunction Practice
**Given**:
- p: "Rebecca's PC has more than 16 GB free hard disk space"
- q: "The processor in Rebecca's PC runs faster than 1 GHz"

**Conjunction (p ∧ q)**: "Rebecca's PC has more than 16 GB free hard disk space, and the processor in Rebecca's PC runs faster than 1 GHz"

**Simplified**: "Rebecca's PC has more than 16 GB free hard disk space, and its processor runs faster than 1 GHz"

**When true**: Both conditions must be satisfied
**When false**: One or both conditions are not satisfied

### 1.3.3 Disjunction (∨)

**Definition**: The disjunction of p and q, denoted p ∨ q, is "p or q." False only when both p and q are false.

**Truth Table**:
| p | q | p ∨ q |
|---|---|-------|
| T | T |   T   |
| T | F |   T   |
| F | T |   T   |
| F | F |   F   |

#### Example 6: Disjunction in Academic Context
**Statement**: "Students who have taken calculus or introductory computer science can take this class"

**Propositions**:
- p: "A student who has taken calculus can take this class"
- q: "A student who has taken introductory computer science can take this class"

**Translation**: p ∨ q (inclusive or)
**Explanation**: Students can take the class if they've taken calculus, computer science, or both.

#### Example 7: Disjunction Practice
**Using propositions from Example 5**:
**Disjunction (p ∨ q)**: "Rebecca's PC has at least 16 GB free hard disk space, or the processor in Rebecca's PC runs faster than 1 GHz"

**When true**: At least one condition is satisfied (or both)
**When false**: Both conditions are not satisfied

### 1.3.4 Exclusive Or (⊕)

**Definition**: The exclusive or of p and q, denoted p ⊕ q, is true when exactly one of p and q is true.

**Truth Table**:
| p | q | p ⊕ q |
|---|---|-------|
| T | T |   F   |
| T | F |   T   |
| F | T |   T   |
| F | F |   F   |

#### Example 8: Exclusive Or in Dining
**Given**:
- p: "A student can have a salad with dinner"
- q: "A student can have soup with dinner"

**Exclusive Or (p ⊕ q)**: "A student can have soup or salad, but not both, with dinner"

#### Example 9: Exclusive Or with Savings
**Statement**: "I will use all my savings to travel to Europe or to buy an electric car"

**Propositions**:
- p: "I will use all my savings to travel to Europe"
- q: "I will use all my savings to buy an electric car"

**Translation**: p ⊕ q
**Explanation**: Cannot do both since each requires all savings.

## 1.4 Conditional Statements

### 1.4.1 Basic Conditional (→)

**Definition**: The conditional statement p → q is "if p, then q." False only when p is true and q is false.

**Truth Table**:
| p | q | p → q |
|---|---|-------|
| T | T |   T   |
| T | F |   F   |
| F | T |   T   |
| F | F |   T   |

**Terminology**:
- p: hypothesis (antecedent, premise)
- q: conclusion (consequence)

#### Various Ways to Express p → q:
- "if p, then q"
- "p implies q"
- "p only if q"
- "p is sufficient for q"
- "q if p"
- "q whenever p"
- "q is necessary for p"
- "q unless ¬p"

#### Example 10: Conditional Statement Practice
**Given**:
- p: "Maria learns discrete mathematics"
- q: "Maria will find a good job"

**Conditional (p → q)**: "If Maria learns discrete mathematics, then she will find a good job"

**Alternative expressions**:
- "Maria will find a good job when she learns discrete mathematics"
- "For Maria to get a good job, it is sufficient for her to learn discrete mathematics"
- "Maria will find a good job unless she does not learn discrete mathematics"

#### Example 11: Programming Context
**Statement**: `if 2 + 2 = 4 then x := x + 1`
**Initial condition**: x = 0

**Solution**: Since 2 + 2 = 4 is true, the assignment x := x + 1 is executed.
**Result**: x = 0 + 1 = 1

### 1.4.2 Related Conditional Statements

Given p → q:
- **Converse**: q → p
- **Contrapositive**: ¬q → ¬p
- **Inverse**: ¬p → ¬q

**Important**: Only the contrapositive is equivalent to the original conditional.

#### Example 12: Finding Related Statements
**Original**: "The home team wins whenever it is raining"
**Rewritten**: "If it is raining, then the home team wins"

**Contrapositive**: "If the home team does not win, then it is not raining"
**Converse**: "If the home team wins, then it is raining"
**Inverse**: "If it is not raining, then the home team does not win"

**Note**: Only the contrapositive is equivalent to the original statement.

### 1.4.3 Biconditional (↔)

**Definition**: The biconditional p ↔ q is "p if and only if q." True when p and q have the same truth values.

**Truth Table**:
| p | q | p ↔ q |
|---|---|-------|
| T | T |   T   |
| T | F |   F   |
| F | T |   F   |
| F | F |   T   |

#### Ways to Express p ↔ q:
- "p if and only if q"
- "p is necessary and sufficient for q"
- "if p then q, and conversely"
- "p iff q"
- "p exactly when q"

#### Example 13: Biconditional Practice
**Given**:
- p: "You can take the flight"
- q: "You buy a ticket"

**Biconditional (p ↔ q)**: "You can take the flight if and only if you buy a ticket"

**When true**: Both scenarios occur together (buy ticket and take flight, or neither)
**When false**: One occurs without the other (free trip, or buy ticket but get bumped)

## 1.5 Truth Tables for Compound Propositions

### Example 14: Complex Truth Table
**Compound proposition**: (p ∨ ¬q) → (p ∧ q)

**Step-by-step construction**:

| p | q | ¬q | p ∨ ¬q | p ∧ q | (p ∨ ¬q) → (p ∧ q) |
|---|----|----|--------|-------|---------------------|
| T | T | F  |   T    |   T   |         T           |
| T | F | T  |   T    |   F   |         F           |
| F | T | F  |   F    |   F   |         T           |
| F | F | T  |   T    |   F   |         F           |

**Explanation of each row**:
1. p=T, q=T: ¬q=F, so p∨¬q=T, p∧q=T, therefore T→T=T
2. p=T, q=F: ¬q=T, so p∨¬q=T, p∧q=F, therefore T→F=F
3. p=F, q=T: ¬q=F, so p∨¬q=F, p∧q=F, therefore F→F=T
4. p=F, q=F: ¬q=T, so p∨¬q=T, p∧q=F, therefore T→F=F

## 1.6 Precedence of Logical Operators

**Precedence Order** (highest to lowest):
1. ¬ (negation)
2. ∧ (conjunction)
3. ∨ (disjunction)
4. → (conditional)
5. ↔ (biconditional)

**Examples**:
- ¬p ∧ q means (¬p) ∧ q
- p ∨ q ∧ r means p ∨ (q ∧ r)
- p → q ∨ r means p → (q ∨ r)

## 1.7 Logic and Bit Operations

### Bit Representation
- **1** represents **True (T)**
- **0** represents **False (F)**

### Bit Operations Table
| x | y | x ∨ y (OR) | x ∧ y (AND) | x ⊕ y (XOR) |
|---|---|------------|-------------|-------------|
| 0 | 0 |     0      |      0      |      0      |
| 0 | 1 |     1      |      0      |      1      |
| 1 | 0 |     1      |      0      |      1      |
| 1 | 1 |     1      |      1      |      0      |

### Example 15: Bit String
**Bit string**: 101010011
**Length**: 9 bits

### Example 16: Bitwise Operations
**Given bit strings**:
- String 1: 01 1011 0110
- String 2: 11 0001 1101

**Solutions**:

**Bitwise OR**:
```
01 1011 0110
11 0001 1101
-----------
11 1011 1111
```

**Bitwise AND**:
```
01 1011 0110
11 0001 1101
-----------
01 0001 0100
```

**Bitwise XOR**:
```
01 1011 0110
11 0001 1101
-----------
10 1010 1011
```

**Explanation**:
- OR: 1 if at least one bit is 1
- AND: 1 only if both bits are 1
- XOR: 1 if exactly one bit is 1
