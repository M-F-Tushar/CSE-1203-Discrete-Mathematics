# 1.4 Predicates and Quantifiers - Complete Study Guide

## 1.4.1 Introduction

**Why Predicate Logic?**
- Propositional logic cannot express statements like:
  - "Every computer connected to the university network is functioning properly"
  - "There is a computer on the university network that is under attack"
- Predicate logic provides more expressive power for mathematical and natural language statements

**Key Concepts:**
- **Predicate**: A property that subjects can have
- **Quantifiers**: Enable reasoning about "all" or "some" objects
- **Domain of discourse**: The set of objects under consideration

---

## 1.4.2 Predicates

### Definition
A **predicate** is a statement involving variables that becomes a proposition when values are assigned to the variables.

### Basic Structure
- **P(x)**: x is the subject, P is the predicate
- **Propositional function**: P(x) becomes a proposition when x is assigned a value
- **Truth value**: Depends on the specific value assigned to the variable

### Examples with Solutions

#### Example 1: Simple Predicate
**Problem**: Let P(x) denote "x > 3." What are the truth values of P(4) and P(2)?

**Solution**:
- P(4): "4 > 3" → **True** (since 4 is greater than 3)
- P(2): "2 > 3" → **False** (since 2 is not greater than 3)

#### Example 2: Computer Network Predicate
**Problem**: Let A(x) denote "Computer x is under attack by an intruder." If only CS2 and MATH1 are under attack, what are the truth values of A(CS1), A(CS2), and A(MATH1)?

**Solution**:
- A(CS1): "Computer CS1 is under attack" → **False** (CS1 is not on the attack list)
- A(CS2): "Computer CS2 is under attack" → **True** (CS2 is on the attack list)
- A(MATH1): "Computer MATH1 is under attack" → **True** (MATH1 is on the attack list)

#### Example 3: Two-Variable Predicate
**Problem**: Let Q(x, y) denote "x = y + 3." What are the truth values of Q(1, 2) and Q(3, 0)?

**Solution**:
- Q(1, 2): "1 = 2 + 3" → "1 = 5" → **False**
- Q(3, 0): "3 = 0 + 3" → "3 = 3" → **True**

#### Example 4: Network Connection Predicate
**Problem**: Let A(c, n) denote "Computer c is connected to network n." If MATH1 is connected to CAMPUS2 but not CAMPUS1, what are the values of A(MATH1, CAMPUS1) and A(MATH1, CAMPUS2)?

**Solution**:
- A(MATH1, CAMPUS1): "MATH1 is connected to CAMPUS1" → **False** (not connected)
- A(MATH1, CAMPUS2): "MATH1 is connected to CAMPUS2" → **True** (connected)

#### Example 5: Three-Variable Predicate
**Problem**: Let R(x, y, z) denote "x + y = z." What are the truth values of R(1, 2, 3) and R(0, 0, 1)?

**Solution**:
- R(1, 2, 3): "1 + 2 = 3" → "3 = 3" → **True**
- R(0, 0, 1): "0 + 0 = 1" → "0 = 1" → **False**

### General Form
- **n-ary predicate**: P(x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ)
- **n-place predicate**: Same as n-ary predicate

#### Example 6: Programming Context
**Problem**: Consider the statement "if x > 0 then x := x + 1"

**Explanation**: 
- P(x) represents "x > 0"
- When program executes:
  - If P(x) is true → execute x := x + 1
  - If P(x) is false → skip the assignment

### Preconditions and Postconditions

#### Example 7: Variable Swapping Program
**Problem**: Consider this program to swap variables x and y:
```
temp := x
x := y  
y := temp
```
Find appropriate preconditions and postconditions.

**Solution**:
- **Precondition P(x, y)**: "x = a and y = b" (initial values)
- **Postcondition Q(x, y)**: "x = b and y = a" (swapped values)

**Verification**:
1. Start: x = a, y = b
2. After temp := x: x = a, temp = a, y = b
3. After x := y: x = b, temp = a, y = b
4. After y := temp: x = b, temp = a, y = a
5. Result: x = b, y = a ✓

## 1.4.3 Quantifiers

### Universal Quantifier (∀)

#### Definition
**∀xP(x)** means "P(x) is true for all values of x in the domain"

#### Key Points
- Read as "for all x, P(x)" or "for every x, P(x)"
- **Counterexample**: An element for which P(x) is false
- Domain must always be specified
- False if there exists even one counterexample

#### Example 8: Universal Quantifier - True Case
**Problem**: Let P(x) be "x + 1 > x." What is the truth value of ∀xP(x) where the domain is all real numbers?

**Solution**:
- For any real number x, x + 1 is always greater than x
- Therefore, ∀xP(x) is **True**

#### Example 9: Universal Quantifier - False Case
**Problem**: Let Q(x) be "x < 2." What is the truth value of ∀xQ(x) where the domain is all real numbers?

**Solution**:
- Need to check if x < 2 for all real numbers
- Counterexample: x = 3 makes Q(3) false since 3 ≮ 2
- Therefore, ∀xQ(x) is **False**

#### Example 10: Finding Counterexamples
**Problem**: Show that ∀xP(x) is false where P(x) is "x² > 0" and domain is all integers.

**Solution**:
- Need to find an integer x where x² ≤ 0
- Counterexample: x = 0 → 0² = 0 ≯ 0
- Therefore, ∀xP(x) is **False**

#### Example 11: Natural Language Translation
**Problem**: What does ∀xN(x) mean if N(x) is "Computer x is connected to the network" and domain is all computers on campus?

**Solution**:
- ∀xN(x) means "For every computer x on campus, computer x is connected to the network"
- In English: "Every computer on campus is connected to the network"

#### Example 12: Domain Dependency
**Problem**: What is the truth value of ∀x(x² ≥ x) for:
a) Domain: all real numbers
b) Domain: all integers

**Solution**:
**Analysis**: x² ≥ x ⟺ x² - x ≥ 0 ⟺ x(x-1) ≥ 0 ⟺ x ≤ 0 or x ≥ 1

a) **Real numbers**: **False**
   - Counterexample: x = 1/2 → (1/2)² = 1/4 < 1/2
   - False for all x where 0 < x < 1

b) **Integers**: **True**
   - No integers exist where 0 < x < 1
   - All integers satisfy x ≤ 0 or x ≥ 1

### Existential Quantifier (∃)

#### Definition
**∃xP(x)** means "There exists an element x in the domain such that P(x)"

#### Key Points
- Read as "there exists x such that P(x)" or "for some x, P(x)"
- True if at least one element satisfies P(x)
- False if no element satisfies P(x)

#### Example 13: Existential Quantifier - True Case
**Problem**: Let P(x) be "x > 3." What is the truth value of ∃xP(x) where domain is all real numbers?

**Solution**:
- Need to find at least one real number x where x > 3
- Example: x = 4 satisfies "4 > 3"
- Therefore, ∃xP(x) is **True**

#### Example 14: Existential Quantifier - False Case
**Problem**: Let Q(x) be "x = x + 1." What is the truth value of ∃xQ(x) where domain is all real numbers?

**Solution**:
- Need to find a real number x where x = x + 1
- This would require 0 = 1, which is impossible
- Q(x) is false for every real number x
- Therefore, ∃xQ(x) is **False**

### Uniqueness Quantifier (∃!)

#### Definition
**∃!xP(x)** means "There exists a unique x such that P(x)"

#### Example
- ∃!x(x - 1 = 0) in real numbers
- Only x = 1 satisfies this equation
- Therefore, the statement is true

## 1.4.4 Quantifiers Over Finite Domains

### Universal Quantifier Over Finite Domain
When domain = {x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ}:
**∀xP(x) ≡ P(x₁) ∧ P(x₂) ∧ ... ∧ P(xₙ)**

#### Example 15: Finite Universal Quantification
**Problem**: What is the truth value of ∀xP(x) where P(x) is "x² < 10" and domain is {1, 2, 3, 4}?

**Solution**:
- ∀xP(x) ≡ P(1) ∧ P(2) ∧ P(3) ∧ P(4)
- P(1): 1² = 1 < 10 → **True**
- P(2): 2² = 4 < 10 → **True** 
- P(3): 3² = 9 < 10 → **True**
- P(4): 4² = 16 ≮ 10 → **False**
- Result: True ∧ True ∧ True ∧ False = **False**

### Existential Quantifier Over Finite Domain
When domain = {x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ}:
**∃xP(x) ≡ P(x₁) ∨ P(x₂) ∨ ... ∨ P(xₙ)**

#### Example 16: Finite Existential Quantification
**Problem**: What is the truth value of ∃xP(x) where P(x) is "x² > 10" and domain is {1, 2, 3, 4}?

**Solution**:
- ∃xP(x) ≡ P(1) ∨ P(2) ∨ P(3) ∨ P(4)
- P(1): 1² = 1 ≯ 10 → **False**
- P(2): 2² = 4 ≯ 10 → **False**
- P(3): 3² = 9 ≯ 10 → **False**
- P(4): 4² = 16 > 10 → **True**
- Result: False ∨ False ∨ False ∨ True = **True**

---

## 1.4.5 Quantifiers with Restricted Domains

### Notation
- **∀x < 0 (P(x))** ≡ **∀x(x < 0 → P(x))**
- **∃x > 0 (P(x))** ≡ **∃x(x > 0 ∧ P(x))**

#### Example 17: Restricted Domain Quantifiers
**Problem**: What do these statements mean (domain: real numbers)?
a) ∀x < 0 (x² > 0)
b) ∀y ≠ 0 (y³ ≠ 0)  
c) ∃z > 0 (z² = 2)

**Solution**:
a) **∀x < 0 (x² > 0)**
   - Equivalent to: ∀x(x < 0 → x² > 0)
   - Meaning: "For every negative real number x, x² > 0"
   - English: "The square of a negative real number is positive"

b) **∀y ≠ 0 (y³ ≠ 0)**
   - Equivalent to: ∀y(y ≠ 0 → y³ ≠ 0)
   - Meaning: "For every nonzero real number y, y³ ≠ 0"
   - English: "The cube of every nonzero real number is nonzero"

c) **∃z > 0 (z² = 2)**
   - Equivalent to: ∃z(z > 0 ∧ z² = 2)
   - Meaning: "There exists a positive real number z such that z² = 2"
   - English: "There is a positive square root of 2"

---

## 1.4.6 Precedence of Quantifiers

**Rule**: Quantifiers ∀ and ∃ have higher precedence than all logical operators

### Example
- **∀xP(x) ∨ Q(x)** means **(∀xP(x)) ∨ Q(x)**
- NOT **∀x(P(x) ∨ Q(x))**

---

## 1.4.7 Binding Variables

### Definitions
- **Bound variable**: Variable quantified by a quantifier
- **Free variable**: Variable not bound by any quantifier
- **Scope**: The part of expression to which a quantifier applies

#### Example 18: Variable Binding
**Problem**: Identify bound and free variables in:
a) ∃x(x + y = 1)
b) ∃x(P(x) ∧ Q(x)) ∨ ∀xR(x)

**Solution**:
a) **∃x(x + y = 1)**
   - x is **bound** by ∃x
   - y is **free** (not quantified)

b) **∃x(P(x) ∧ Q(x)) ∨ ∀xR(x)**
   - First x is **bound** by ∃x with scope P(x) ∧ Q(x)
   - Second x is **bound** by ∀x with scope R(x)
   - All variables are bound
   - Could rewrite as: ∃x(P(x) ∧ Q(x)) ∨ ∀yR(y)

---

## 1.4.8 Logical Equivalences Involving Quantifiers

### Definition
Statements with predicates and quantifiers are logically equivalent if they have the same truth value for all possible predicates and domains.

#### Example 19: Distribution of Universal Quantifier
**Problem**: Show that ∀x(P(x) ∧ Q(x)) ≡ ∀xP(x) ∧ ∀xQ(x)

**Solution**:
**Proof in two directions:**

**Direction 1**: ∀x(P(x) ∧ Q(x)) → ∀xP(x) ∧ ∀xQ(x)
- Assume ∀x(P(x) ∧ Q(x)) is true
- For any element a in domain: P(a) ∧ Q(a) is true
- Therefore: P(a) is true AND Q(a) is true
- Since this holds for all a: ∀xP(x) is true AND ∀xQ(x) is true
- Therefore: ∀xP(x) ∧ ∀xQ(x) is true

**Direction 2**: ∀xP(x) ∧ ∀xQ(x) → ∀x(P(x) ∧ Q(x))
- Assume ∀xP(x) ∧ ∀xQ(x) is true
- Then: ∀xP(x) is true AND ∀xQ(x) is true
- For any element a in domain: P(a) is true AND Q(a) is true
- Therefore: P(a) ∧ Q(a) is true
- Since this holds for all a: ∀x(P(x) ∧ Q(x)) is true

**Conclusion**: ∀x(P(x) ∧ Q(x)) ≡ ∀xP(x) ∧ ∀xQ(x) ✓

## 1.4.9 Negating Quantified Expressions

### De Morgan's Laws for Quantifiers

| Negation | Equivalent | When True | When False |
|----------|------------|-----------|------------|
| ¬∃xP(x) | ∀x¬P(x) | P(x) is false for every x | There exists x where P(x) is true |
| ¬∀xP(x) | ∃x¬P(x) | There exists x where P(x) is false | P(x) is true for every x |

#### Example 20: Negating Quantified Statements
**Problem**: What are the negations of:
a) "There is an honest politician"
b) "All Americans eat cheeseburgers"

**Solution**:
a) **"There is an honest politician"**
   - Let H(x) = "x is honest", domain = all politicians
   - Statement: ∃xH(x)
   - Negation: ¬∃xH(x) ≡ ∀x¬H(x)
   - English: "Every politician is dishonest"

b) **"All Americans eat cheeseburgers"**
   - Let C(x) = "x eats cheeseburgers", domain = all Americans
   - Statement: ∀xC(x)
   - Negation: ¬∀xC(x) ≡ ∃x¬C(x)
   - English: "Some American does not eat cheeseburgers"

#### Example 21: Negating Mathematical Statements
**Problem**: Find the negations of:
a) ∀x(x² > x)
b) ∃x(x² = 2)

**Solution**:
a) **∀x(x² > x)**
   - Negation: ¬∀x(x² > x) ≡ ∃x¬(x² > x) ≡ ∃x(x² ≤ x)

b) **∃x(x² = 2)**
   - Negation: ¬∃x(x² = 2) ≡ ∀x¬(x² = 2) ≡ ∀x(x² ≠ 2)

#### Example 22: Complex Negation
**Problem**: Show that ¬∀x(P(x) → Q(x)) ≡ ∃x(P(x) ∧ ¬Q(x))

**Solution**:
1. **Apply De Morgan's law**: ¬∀x(P(x) → Q(x)) ≡ ∃x¬(P(x) → Q(x))
2. **Use implication equivalence**: ¬(P(x) → Q(x)) ≡ P(x) ∧ ¬Q(x)
3. **Substitute**: ∃x¬(P(x) → Q(x)) ≡ ∃x(P(x) ∧ ¬Q(x))

Therefore: ¬∀x(P(x) → Q(x)) ≡ ∃x(P(x) ∧ ¬Q(x)) ✓

## 1.4.10 Translating from English into Logical Expressions

### General Strategy
1. Identify the quantifier type (universal/existential)
2. Choose appropriate domain
3. Define predicates clearly
4. Consider multiple valid approaches

#### Example 23: Universal Quantification
**Problem**: Express "Every student in this class has studied calculus"

**Solution**:
**Approach 1** (Domain: students in this class):
- Let C(x) = "x has studied calculus"
- Expression: ∀xC(x)

**Approach 2** (Domain: all people):
- Let S(x) = "x is a student in this class"
- Let C(x) = "x has studied calculus"  
- Expression: ∀x(S(x) → C(x))

**Approach 3** (Two-variable predicate):
- Let Q(x,y) = "Student x has studied subject y"
- Expression: ∀xQ(x, calculus) or ∀x(S(x) → Q(x, calculus))

#### Example 24: Mixed Quantifications
**Problem**: Express using predicates and quantifiers:
a) "Some student in this class has visited Mexico"
b) "Every student in this class has visited either Canada or Mexico"

**Solution**:
a) **"Some student in this class has visited Mexico"**

**Approach 1** (Domain: students in this class):
- Let M(x) = "x has visited Mexico"
- Expression: ∃xM(x)

**Approach 2** (Domain: all people):
- Let S(x) = "x is a student in this class"
- Let M(x) = "x has visited Mexico"
- Expression: ∃x(S(x) ∧ M(x))

b) **"Every student in this class has visited either Canada or Mexico"**

**Approach 1** (Domain: students in this class):
- Let C(x) = "x has visited Canada"
- Let M(x) = "x has visited Mexico"
- Expression: ∀x(C(x) ∨ M(x))

**Approach 2** (Domain: all people):
- Expression: ∀x(S(x) → (C(x) ∨ M(x)))

## 1.4.11 Using Quantifiers in System Specifications

#### Example 25: System Specifications
**Problem**: Express these specifications using predicates and quantifiers:
a) "Every mail message larger than one megabyte will be compressed"
b) "If a user is active, at least one network link will be available"

**Solution**:
a) **Mail compression specification**:
- Let S(m,y) = "Mail message m is larger than y megabytes"
- Let C(m) = "Mail message m will be compressed"
- Expression: ∀m(S(m,1) → C(m))

b) **Network availability specification**:
- Let A(u) = "User u is active"
- Let S(n,x) = "Network link n is in state x"
- Expression: ∃uA(u) → ∃nS(n, available)

---

## 1.4.12 Examples from Lewis Carroll

#### Example 26: Lewis Carroll Logic - Lions
**Problem**: Express this argument using quantifiers:
- "All lions are fierce"
- "Some lions do not drink coffee"  
- "Some fierce creatures do not drink coffee"

**Solution**:
**Predicates**:
- P(x) = "x is a lion"
- Q(x) = "x is fierce"  
- R(x) = "x drinks coffee"
- Domain = all creatures

**Statements**:
1. ∀x(P(x) → Q(x))
2. ∃x(P(x) ∧ ¬R(x))
3. ∃x(Q(x) ∧ ¬R(x))

**Note**: Statement 2 cannot be ∃x(P(x) → ¬R(x)) because this would be true whenever x is not a lion, regardless of coffee-drinking habits.

#### Example 27: Lewis Carroll Logic - Hummingbirds
**Problem**: Express this argument:
- "All hummingbirds are richly colored"
- "No large birds live on honey"
- "Birds that do not live on honey are dull in color"
- "Hummingbirds are small"

**Solution**:
**Predicates**:
- P(x) = "x is a hummingbird"
- Q(x) = "x is large"
- R(x) = "x lives on honey"
- S(x) = "x is richly colored"
- Domain = all birds

**Statements**:
1. ∀x(P(x) → S(x))
2. ¬∃x(Q(x) ∧ R(x)) [equivalent to ∀x(Q(x) → ¬R(x))]
3. ∀x(¬R(x) → ¬S(x))
4. ∀x(P(x) → ¬Q(x))

---

## 1.4.13 Logic Programming

### Prolog Basics
- **Prolog facts**: Define predicates by specifying satisfying elements
- **Prolog rules**: Define new predicates using existing ones
- **Queries**: Ask questions about the defined predicates

#### Example 28: Prolog Program
**Problem**: Create a Prolog program for course enrollment and teaching relationships.

**Solution**:
**Facts**:
```prolog
instructor(chan,math273)
instructor(patel,ee222)
instructor(grossman,cs301)
enrolled(kevin,math273)
enrolled(juana,ee222)
enrolled(juana,cs301)
enrolled(kiko,math273)
enrolled(kiko,cs301)
```

**Rule**:
```prolog
teaches(P,S) :- instructor(P,C), enrolled(S,C)
```
*Meaning*: Professor P teaches student S if there exists a course C such that P instructs C and S is enrolled in C.

**Sample Queries and Responses**:
- Query: `?enrolled(kevin,math273)` → Response: `yes`
- Query: `?enrolled(X,math273)` → Response: `kevin, kiko`
- Query: `?teaches(X,juana)` → Response: `patel, grossman`
