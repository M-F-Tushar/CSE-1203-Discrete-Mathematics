## 1.8.1 Introduction

This section continues the development of proof methods introduced in Section 1.7. We explore several additional commonly used proof techniques and delve deeper into the **art and science of constructing proofs**.

### New Methods Covered
- **Proof by cases** - handling different scenarios separately

- **Existence proofs** - proving something exists
- **Uniqueness proofs** - proving only one solution exists
- **Advanced proof strategies** - finding and constructing proofs

### The Mathematical Process
Mathematicians don't just prove theorems - they:
1. **Formulate conjectures** based on patterns or intuition
2. **Attempt to prove or disprove** these conjectures
3. **Look for counterexamples** when proofs seem difficult
4. **Adapt existing proofs** for similar problems

## 1.8.2 Exhaustive Proof and Proof by Cases

### Theoretical Foundation

**Rule of Inference for Proof by Cases:**
To prove (p₁ ∨ p₂ ∨ ... ∨ pₙ) → q, use the tautology:
[(p₁ ∨ p₂ ∨ ... ∨ pₙ) → q] ↔ [(p₁ → q) ∧ (p₂ → q) ∧ ... ∧ (pₙ → q)]

This means we can prove the original statement by proving each case pᵢ → q individually.

### Exhaustive Proof

**Definition:** An **exhaustive proof** (or proof by exhaustion) examines all possible cases by checking each one individually. This is a special type of proof by cases where each case involves a single example.

#### Example 1: Inequality Verification
**Theorem:** (n + 1)³ ≥ 3ⁿ if n is a positive integer with n ≤ 4.

**Exhaustive Proof:**
We check each possible value:

- **n = 1:** (1+1)³ = 2³ = 8, and 3¹ = 3. Since 8 ≥ 3 ✓
- **n = 2:** (2+1)³ = 3³ = 27, and 3² = 9. Since 27 ≥ 9 ✓  
- **n = 3:** (3+1)³ = 4³ = 64, and 3³ = 27. Since 64 ≥ 27 ✓
- **n = 4:** (4+1)³ = 5³ = 125, and 3⁴ = 81. Since 125 ≥ 81 ✓

Since the inequality holds in all four cases, the theorem is proven.

#### Example 2: Perfect Powers
**Theorem:** The only consecutive positive integers not exceeding 100 that are perfect powers are 8 and 9.

**Definition:** An integer n is a **perfect power** if n = mᵃ where m is an integer and a is an integer greater than 1.

**Exhaustive Proof:**
We systematically list all perfect powers ≤ 100:

- **Squares:** 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100
- **Cubes:** 1, 8, 27, 64
- **Fourth powers:** 1, 16, 81
- **Fifth powers:** 1, 32
- **Sixth powers:** 1, 64
- **Higher powers:** Only 1

Examining consecutive pairs: Only 8 = 2³ and 9 = 3² are consecutive perfect powers.

### Proof by Cases

**When to use:** When different conditions require different approaches, but all possibilities must be covered.

#### Example 3: Quadratic Inequality
**Theorem:** If n is an integer, then n² ≥ n.

**Proof by Cases:**
We consider all possible integer values by dividing into three cases:

**Case 1: n = 0**
- n² = 0² = 0 and n = 0
- Since 0 ≥ 0, the inequality holds

**Case 2: n ≥ 1**  
- Since n ≥ 1 and n > 0, multiplying both sides by n gives:
- n · n ≥ n · 1
- Therefore n² ≥ n

**Case 3: n ≤ -1**
- Since n ≤ -1, we have n < 0
- But n² ≥ 0 (squares are non-negative)
- Since n < 0 and n² ≥ 0, we have n² ≥ n

All cases are covered, so n² ≥ n for all integers n.

#### Example 4: Absolute Value Property
**Theorem:** |xy| = |x||y| for all real numbers x and y.

**Proof by Cases:**
We need four cases since both x and y can be positive or negative:

**Case 1: x ≥ 0 and y ≥ 0**
- xy ≥ 0, so |xy| = xy
- |x| = x and |y| = y
- Therefore |xy| = xy = |x||y| ✓

**Case 2: x ≥ 0 and y < 0**
- xy ≤ 0, so |xy| = -xy = x(-y)
- |x| = x and |y| = -y
- Therefore |xy| = x(-y) = |x||y| ✓

**Case 3: x < 0 and y ≥ 0**
- Similar to Case 2 with roles reversed
- |xy| = -xy = (-x)y = |x||y| ✓

**Case 4: x < 0 and y < 0**
- xy > 0, so |xy| = xy = (-x)(-y)
- |x| = -x and |y| = -y  
- Therefore |xy| = xy = (-x)(-y) = |x||y| ✓

#### Example 5: Pattern Discovery
**Conjecture:** What are the possible final digits of perfect squares?

**Analysis:** By examining small squares: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100...
We observe final digits: 1, 4, 9, 6, 5, 6, 9, 4, 1, 0...
**Conjecture:** The final digit of n² can only be 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, or 9.

**Proof by Cases:**
Any integer n can be written as n = 10a + b where b ∈ {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}.

Since n² = (10a + b)² = 100a² + 20ab + b² = 10(10a² + 2ab) + b²,
the final digit of n² equals the final digit of b².

Also, note that (10-b)² = 100 - 20b + b² has the same final digit as b².

**Case 1:** b = 1 or b = 9 → b² ends in 1
**Case 2:** b = 2 or b = 8 → b² ends in 4  
**Case 3:** b = 3 or b = 7 → b² ends in 9
**Case 4:** b = 4 or b = 6 → b² ends in 6
**Case 5:** b = 5 → b² ends in 5
**Case 6:** b = 0 → b² ends in 0

Therefore, perfect squares can only end in 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, or 9.

#### Example 6: Diophantine Equation
**Theorem:** There are no integer solutions to x² + 3y² = 8.

**Proof by Cases:**
Since x² > 8 when |x| ≥ 3 and 3y² > 8 when |y| ≥ 2, we only need to check:
- x ∈ {-2, -1, 0, 1, 2}
- y ∈ {-1, 0, 1}

**Exhaustive check:**
- Possible values of x²: 0, 1, 4
- Possible values of 3y²: 0, 3
- Maximum possible sum: 4 + 3 = 7 < 8

Therefore, x² + 3y² ≤ 7 < 8 for all allowed values, proving no solutions exist.

### Without Loss of Generality (WLOG)

**Principle:** We can assume a particular case without losing generality when other cases follow by similar arguments or symmetric considerations.

#### Example 7: Even Products and Sums
**Theorem:** If x and y are integers and both xy and x + y are even, then both x and y are even.

**Proof (by contraposition with WLOG):**
Assume not both x and y are even, so at least one is odd.
**Without loss of generality,** assume x is odd, so x = 2m + 1.

**Case 1: y is even** (y = 2n)
- x + y = (2m + 1) + 2n = 2(m + n) + 1 (odd)
- This contradicts the assumption that x + y is even

**Case 2: y is odd** (y = 2n + 1)  
- xy = (2m + 1)(2n + 1) = 4mn + 2m + 2n + 1 = 2(2mn + m + n) + 1 (odd)
- This contradicts the assumption that xy is even

Therefore, both x and y must be even.

**Note:** WLOG is justified because if y were odd instead of x, we could apply the same argument with roles reversed.

### Common Errors

#### Example 8: Insufficient Checking
**False Conclusion:** Every positive integer is the sum of 18 fourth powers.

**Error:** Testing only small cases (n ≤ 78) and concluding the pattern holds universally.
**Reality:** n = 79 cannot be written as the sum of 18 fourth powers, providing a counterexample.

**Lesson:** Exhaustive proof requires checking ALL possible cases, not just many cases.

#### Example 9: Missing Cases
**False "Theorem":** If x is a real number, then x² is positive.

**False "Proof":**
- Case 1 (x > 0): x² > 0 since product of positives is positive ✓
- Case 2 (x < 0): x² > 0 since product of negatives is positive ✓

**Error:** Missing the case x = 0, where x² = 0 is not positive.
**Correct division:** x > 0, x < 0, x = 0

## 1.8.3 Existence Proofs

**Definition:** An **existence proof** proves a statement of the form ∃xP(x) - that there exists an element with property P.

### Types of Existence Proofs

#### Constructive Existence Proof
**Method:** Find a specific element a such that P(a) is true. This element a is called a **witness**.

#### Example 10: Sum of Cubes
**Theorem:** There exists a positive integer that can be written as the sum of cubes in two different ways.

**Constructive Proof:**
We provide the specific example: **1729**

Verification:
- 1729 = 10³ + 9³ = 1000 + 729 = 1729 ✓
- 1729 = 12³ + 1³ = 1728 + 1 = 1729 ✓

Since we have exhibited such a number, the existence is proven.

**Historical Note:** This is the famous "Hardy-Ramanujan number." When Hardy visited the ill Ramanujan and mentioned that his taxi number 1729 seemed dull, Ramanujan replied it was actually very interesting - the smallest number expressible as the sum of cubes in two different ways.

### Nonconstructive Existence Proof
**Method:** Prove ∃xP(x) is true without explicitly finding such an x. Often uses proof by contradiction: assume ∀x¬P(x) and derive a contradiction.

#### Example 11: Irrational Numbers
**Theorem:** There exist irrational numbers x and y such that x^y is rational.

**Nonconstructive Proof:**
We know √2 is irrational. Consider the number (√2)^(√2).

**Case 1:** If (√2)^(√2) is rational
- Let x = √2 and y = √2
- Then x^y = (√2)^(√2) is rational ✓

**Case 2:** If (√2)^(√2) is irrational  
- Let x = (√2)^(√2) and y = √2
- Then x^y = ((√2)^(√2))^(√2) = (√2)^(√2·√2) = (√2)² = 2 (rational) ✓

**Conclusion:** Either the pair (√2, √2) or the pair ((√2)^(√2), √2) works, but we don't know which one!

This is nonconstructive because we haven't determined which specific pair satisfies the property.

### Example 12: Game Theory Application (Chomp)

**Chomp** is a game played on a rectangular grid of cookies with the top-left cookie poisoned. Players take turns eating a cookie along with all cookies to its right and/or below. The player forced to eat the poisoned cookie loses.

**Question:** Does the first player have a winning strategy?

**Nonconstructive Existence Proof:**
The first player can always win, though we don't specify the strategy.

**Proof:**
1. The game always ends (finite number of cookies)
2. Consider the first player's opening move: eat only the bottom-right cookie
3. **Either:**
   - This move is part of a winning strategy for player 1, OR
   - Player 2 has a winning response
4. **If player 2 has a winning response:** Player 1 could have made that same move initially (it's always legal to eat any cookie and those below/right of it)
5. **Therefore:** Player 1 can always secure a winning strategy

This proof shows a winning strategy exists but doesn't describe the actual moves.

---

## 1.8.4 Uniqueness Proofs

**Structure:** To prove "there exists a unique x such that P(x)," we must show:
1. **Existence:** Some x with property P exists
2. **Uniqueness:** If both x and y have property P, then x = y

**Logical form:** ∃x(P(x) ∧ ∀y(y ≠ x → ¬P(y)))

### Example 13: Linear Equation Solution
**Theorem:** If a and b are real numbers and a ≠ 0, then there is a unique real number r such that ar + b = 0.

**Proof:**

**Existence Part:**
Let r = -b/a. Then:
ar + b = a(-b/a) + b = -b + b = 0 ✓

So a solution exists.

**Uniqueness Part:**
Suppose s is any real number such that as + b = 0.
Then ar + b = as + b (both equal 0)
Subtracting b: ar = as
Dividing by a (since a ≠ 0): r = s

Therefore, any solution must equal r = -b/a, proving uniqueness.

---

## 1.8.5 Proof Strategies

### Forward vs. Backward Reasoning

#### Forward Reasoning
- **Start:** With premises/hypotheses
- **Process:** Use axioms, theorems, and rules of inference
- **End:** Reach the desired conclusion
- **Best for:** Relatively simple, direct proofs

#### Backward Reasoning  
- **Start:** With the conclusion you want to prove
- **Process:** Find intermediate statements that would imply the conclusion
- **End:** Trace back to known facts
- **Best for:** Complex proofs where the forward path is unclear

### Example 14: Arithmetic vs. Geometric Mean
**Theorem:** If x and y are distinct positive real numbers, then their arithmetic mean exceeds their geometric mean: (x + y)/2 > √(xy).

**Backward Reasoning Process:**
We want to prove: (x + y)/2 > √(xy)

Working backward through equivalent inequalities:
- (x + y)/2 > √(xy)
- (x + y)²/4 > xy                    (square both sides)
- (x + y)² > 4xy                     (multiply by 4)  
- x² + 2xy + y² > 4xy               (expand)
- x² - 2xy + y² > 0                 (subtract 4xy)
- (x - y)² > 0                      (factor)

Since x ≠ y, we have (x - y)² > 0, which is true!

**Forward Proof:**
Since x ≠ y, we have (x - y)² > 0
⟹ x² - 2xy + y² > 0
⟹ x² + 2xy + y² > 4xy  
⟹ (x + y)² > 4xy
⟹ (x + y)²/4 > xy
⟹ (x + y)/2 > √(xy)     (taking square roots)

### Example 15: Game Strategy
**Game:** Two players remove 1, 2, or 3 stones from a pile of 15 stones. The player who takes the last stone wins. Show the first player can always win.

**Backward Reasoning:**
- **To win:** Be left with 1, 2, or 3 stones on your turn
- **Force this:** Leave your opponent with 4 stones
- **To leave 4:** Start your turn with 5, 6, or 7 stones  
- **Force this:** Leave your opponent with 8 stones
- **To leave 8:** Start your turn with 9, 10, or 11 stones
- **Force this:** Leave your opponent with 12 stones
- **To leave 12:** Remove 3 stones from the initial 15

**Winning Strategy:** Always leave your opponent with a multiple of 4 stones (12, 8, 4). Whatever they take (1, 2, or 3), you can always restore the next multiple of 4.

### Adapting Existing Proofs

#### Example 16: Extending Irrationality Proofs
We proved √2 is irrational. Can we adapt this proof for √3?

**Original proof structure for √2:**
1. Assume √2 = a/b in lowest terms
2. Then 2b² = a²
3. This makes a² even, so a is even
4. Let a = 2c, then 2b² = 4c², so b² = 2c²  
5. This makes b² even, so b is even
6. Contradiction: both a and b are even

**Adaptation for √3:**
1. Assume √3 = c/d in lowest terms  
2. Then 3d² = c²
3. Since 3 divides c², it must divide c (needs number theory from Chapter 4)
4. Let c = 3k, then 3d² = 9k², so d² = 3k²
5. Since 3 divides d², it must divide d
6. Contradiction: both c and d are divisible by 3

This pattern extends to √n for any non-perfect-square n.

## 1.8.6 Looking for Counterexamples

**Strategy:** When attempting to prove a statement, also consider whether it might be false. Look for counterexamples, especially among the smallest or simplest cases.

### Example 17: Sum of Squares Investigation

**Question:** Is every positive integer the sum of the squares of three integers?

**Counterexample Search:**
Testing small integers:
- 1 = 0² + 0² + 1² ✓
- 2 = 0² + 1² + 1² ✓  
- 3 = 1² + 1² + 1² ✓
- 4 = 0² + 0² + 2² ✓
- 5 = 0² + 1² + 2² ✓
- 6 = 1² + 1² + 2² ✓
- 7 = ? 

For 7, we need three squares that sum to 7. Available squares ≤ 7: {0, 1, 4}
Possible combinations:
- 0 + 0 + 0 = 0
- 0 + 0 + 1 = 1  
- 0 + 0 + 4 = 4
- 0 + 1 + 1 = 2
- 0 + 1 + 4 = 5
- 0 + 4 + 4 = 8 > 7
- 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
- 1 + 1 + 4 = 6
- 1 + 4 + 4 = 9 > 7
- 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 > 7

**No combination equals 7!** So 7 is a counterexample.

**Follow-up:** What about four squares? 
7 = 1² + 1² + 1² + 2² ✓

**Theorem:** Every positive integer is the sum of four squares of integers (this is true - Lagrange's four-square theorem).

---

## 1.8.7 Proof Strategy in Action

**The Mathematical Process:**
1. **Explore** concepts and examples
2. **Ask questions** about patterns
3. **Formulate conjectures** 
4. **Attempt proofs or find counterexamples**
5. **Refine understanding** based on results

Mathematics isn't just about formal proofs - it's about discovery, conjecture, and exploration.

---

## 1.8.8 Tilings

**Definitions:**
- **Checkerboard:** Rectangle divided into unit squares
- **Standard checkerboard:** 8×8 checkerboard  
- **Domino:** 1×2 rectangular piece
- **Tiling:** Covering all squares with pieces, no overlaps or overhangs

### Example 18: Basic Tiling
**Question:** Can we tile the standard checkerboard with dominoes?

**Answer:** Yes! Many ways exist:
- Place 32 dominoes horizontally
- Place 32 dominoes vertically  
- Mix horizontal and vertical placements

**Proof type:** Constructive existence proof (showing one such tiling suffices)

### Example 19: Impossible Tiling
**Question:** Can we tile a standard checkerboard with one corner removed?

**Analysis:**
- Original board: 64 squares
- After removing corner: 63 squares
- Each domino covers exactly 2 squares
- For tiling to exist: number of squares must be even
- 63 is odd

**Proof by contradiction:** No tiling exists because 63 is odd and each domino covers an even number of squares.

### Example 20: Coloring Arguments
**Question:** Can we tile a standard checkerboard with two opposite corners removed?

**First attempt:** 
- Remaining squares: 64 - 2 = 62 (even)
- Can't immediately rule out based on counting alone

**Key insight:** Use a coloring argument!

**Proof by contradiction:**
1. Color the checkerboard alternately black and white
2. Each domino covers exactly one black and one white square
3. Any tiling with 31 dominoes covers 31 black and 31 white squares
4. **But:** Removing opposite corners removes either:
   - 32 white, 30 black squares, OR
   - 30 white, 32 black squares
5. **Contradiction:** Can't cover unequal numbers with dominoes that each cover one of each color

### Triominoes

**Straight triomino:** Three squares in a row
**Right triomino:** L-shaped piece of three squares

### Example 21: Triomino Impossibility
**Question:** Can straight triominoes tile a standard checkerboard?

**Analysis:**
- Standard board: 64 squares
- Each triomino: 3 squares
- For tiling: 64 must be divisible by 3
- But 64 = 3×21 + 1, so 64 ≢ 0 (mod 3)

**Conclusion:** Impossible due to counting argument.

### Example 22: Three-Color Argument
**Question:** Can straight triominoes tile a standard checkerboard with one corner removed?

**Setup:**
- Remaining squares: 63 (divisible by 3 ✓)
- Color the board with three colors cyclically

**Coloring pattern:** In the standard coloring, there are:
- 21 blue squares
- 21 black squares  
- 22 white squares

**Key observation:** Each straight triomino covers exactly one square of each color.

**Proof by contradiction:**
1. Any tiling uses 63/3 = 21 triominoes
2. These cover 21 blue, 21 black, 21 white squares
3. **But:** After removing a corner square (assume blue), we have:
   - 20 blue squares
   - 21 black squares
   - 22 white squares
4. **Contradiction:** Cannot cover 20 blue squares with triominoes that each cover exactly 1 blue square

---

## 1.8.9 The Role of Open Problems

### Fermat's Last Theorem

**Theorem (Proved 1995):** The equation xⁿ + yⁿ = zⁿ has no solutions in integers x, y, z with xyz ≠ 0 when n > 2.

**Historical significance:**
- **1637:** Fermat claims to have a proof (never found)
- **1995:** Andrew Wiles provides first correct proof
- **Impact:** Led to development of algebraic number theory
- **Proof complexity:** Hundreds of pages using advanced elliptic curve theory

**Note:** x² + y² = z² has infinitely many integer solutions (Pythagorean triples)

### The 3x + 1 Conjecture

**Define transformation T:**
- If x is even: T(x) = x/2
- If x is odd: T(x) = 3x + 1

**Conjecture:** For any positive integer x, repeatedly applying T eventually reaches 1.

**Example with x = 13:**
13 → 40 → 20 → 10 → 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1

**Current status:**
- **Verified:** For all x up to 5.48 × 10¹⁸
- **Still open:** No general proof exists
- **Also known as:** Collatz problem, Syracuse problem, Hasse's algorithm

**Warning:** This problem has famously consumed enormous amounts of mathematicians' time - it's been jokingly called part of a conspiracy to slow down mathematical research!

### Why Open Problems Matter

Open problems drive mathematical development by:
1. **Motivating new techniques** - attempts to solve them create new mathematics
2. **Connecting different areas** - solutions often require combining various fields  
3. **Inspiring collaboration** - researchers work together on famous problems
4. **Testing our understanding** - they reveal gaps in current knowledge

**Examples throughout this book:**
- Prime number conjectures (Chapter 4)
- Graph theory problems (Chapter 10)  
- Combinatorial optimization (Chapter 11)

## Summary of Proof Methods

| Method | When to Use | Key Idea |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Direct Proof** | Clear path from hypothesis to conclusion | Start with premises, use logic to reach conclusion |
| **Proof by Contraposition** | Negation of conclusion easier to work with | Prove ¬q → ¬p instead of p → q |
| **Proof by Contradiction** | Statement seems obviously true but hard to prove directly | Assume negation leads to contradiction |
| **Proof by Cases** | Different conditions need different approaches | Divide into exhaustive cases, prove each |
| **Exhaustive Proof** | Small finite number of cases | Check every single possibility |
| **Existence Proof (Constructive)** | Can find specific example | Provide witness that satisfies property |
| **Existence Proof (Nonconstructive)** | Can't find example but can prove existence | Use contradiction or other indirect method |
| **Uniqueness Proof** | Proving "exactly one" | Show existence + uniqueness separately |

## Strategic Advice

1. **Start simple** - understand definitions and examine small examples
2. **Try direct proof first** - it's often the most straightforward when it works
3. **Look for patterns** - small cases often reveal the general structure
4. **Consider the contrapositive** - sometimes much easier than the direct approach
5. **Use proof by contradiction** - when the statement seems "obviously" true
6. **Divide into cases** - when different scenarios need different arguments
7. **Look for counterexamples** - especially when proof attempts fail
8. **Adapt existing proofs** - similar problems often have similar solutions
9. **Work backward** - start from conclusion and find what would imply it
10. **Don't give up** - mathematics is about persistence and creativity

The art of proof lies not just in applying these methods mechanically, but in developing the intuition to choose the right approach and the creativity to see new connections and insights.
