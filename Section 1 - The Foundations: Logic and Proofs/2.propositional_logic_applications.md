## 1.2.2 Translating English Sentences

### Purpose of Translation
- **Ambiguity Removal**: Human languages are often ambiguous
- **Logical Analysis**: Enables truth value determination and manipulation
- **Reasoning**: Allows application of inference rules
- **Assumption Making**: May require reasonable assumptions about intended meaning

### Translation Process
1. Identify key components of the sentence
2. Assign propositional variables to each component
3. Determine appropriate logical connectives
4. Construct the logical expression

### **Example 1: Conditional Statement Translation**

**Problem**: "You can access the Internet from campus only if you are a computer science major or you are not a freshman."

**Solution Process**:
- **Variable Assignment**:
  - `a` = "You can access the Internet from campus"
  - `c` = "You are a computer science major"
  - `f` = "You are a freshman"

- **Key Phrase Recognition**: "only if" indicates a conditional statement
- **Logical Expression**: `a → (c ∨ ¬f)`
- **Reading**: "If you can access the Internet from campus, then you are a computer science major or you are not a freshman"

### **Example 2: Complex Conditional with Unless**

**Problem**: "You cannot ride the roller coaster if you are under 4 feet tall unless you are older than 16 years old."

**Solution Process**:
- **Variable Assignment**:
  - `q` = "You can ride the roller coaster"
  - `r` = "You are under 4 feet tall"
  - `s` = "You are older than 16 years old"

- **Logical Structure Analysis**: 
  - The sentence means: "If you are under 4 feet tall AND not older than 16, then you cannot ride"
- **Logical Expression**: `(r ∧ ¬s) → ¬q`
- **Reading**: "If you are under 4 feet tall and not older than 16, then you cannot ride the roller coaster"

## 1.2.3 System Specifications

### Importance in Engineering
- **Hardware Systems**: Precise specifications prevent development errors
- **Software Systems**: Unambiguous requirements enable proper implementation
- **System Development**: Logical specifications serve as development foundation

### Consistency Requirement
- **Definition**: Specifications must not contain conflicting requirements
- **Problem**: Inconsistent specifications cannot be satisfied simultaneously
- **Solution**: Use logical analysis to detect contradictions

### **Example 3: Basic System Specification**

**Problem**: "The automated reply cannot be sent when the file system is full"

**Solution Process**:
- **Variable Assignment**:
  - `p` = "The automated reply can be sent"
  - `q` = "The file system is full"

- **Negation Understanding**: "cannot be sent" = `¬p`
- **Logical Expression**: `q → ¬p`
- **Reading**: "If the file system is full, then the automated reply cannot be sent"

### **Example 4: Consistency Analysis**

**Problem**: Determine if these specifications are consistent:
1. "The diagnostic message is stored in the buffer or it is retransmitted"
2. "The diagnostic message is not stored in the buffer"
3. "If the diagnostic message is stored in the buffer, then it is retransmitted"

**Solution Process**:
- **Variable Assignment**:
  - `p` = "The diagnostic message is stored in the buffer"
  - `q` = "The diagnostic message is retransmitted"

- **Translation**:
  1. `p ∨ q` (disjunction)
  2. `¬p` (negation)
  3. `p → q` (conditional)

- **Consistency Check**:
  - From specification 2: `p` must be false
  - From specification 1: Since `p` is false, `q` must be true for `p ∨ q` to be true
  - From specification 3: `p → q` is true when `p` is false (regardless of `q`)
  - **Result**: All three are satisfied when `p = false, q = true`
  - **Conclusion**: Specifications are consistent

### **Example 5: Inconsistency Detection**

**Problem**: Do the specifications from Example 4 remain consistent if we add "The diagnostic message is not retransmitted"?

**Solution Process**:
- **New Specification**: `¬q` ("The diagnostic message is not retransmitted")
- **Previous Requirement**: From Example 4, we need `q = true` for consistency
- **Conflict**: `¬q` requires `q = false`, but we need `q = true`
- **Conclusion**: The four specifications are inconsistent

## 1.2.4 Boolean Searches

### Definition and Purpose
- **Boolean Searches**: Search techniques using propositional logic principles
- **Application**: Used in large information collections (web indexes, databases)
- **Advantage**: Precise control over search results

### Logical Connectives in Searches
- **AND**: Match records containing both search terms
- **OR**: Match records containing one or both search terms
- **NOT (AND NOT)**: Exclude records containing specific terms

### **Example 6: Web Page Searching**

**Multiple Search Scenarios**:

1. **Basic Search**: "NEW AND MEXICO AND UNIVERSITIES"
   - **Result**: Pages containing all three words
   - **Issue**: May include unwanted results like "new universities in Mexico"
   - **Improvement**: Use quotes for phrases: "NEW MEXICO" AND UNIVERSITIES

2. **Alternative Search**: "(NEW AND MEXICO OR ARIZONA) AND UNIVERSITIES"
   - **Operator Precedence**: AND takes precedence over OR
   - **Result**: Pages with "UNIVERSITIES" and either ("NEW" and "MEXICO") or "ARIZONA"
   - **Google Format**: NEW MEXICO OR ARIZONA (Google uses all terms by default)

3. **Exclusion Search**: "(MEXICO AND UNIVERSITIES) NOT NEW"
   - **Purpose**: Find universities in Mexico but not New Mexico
   - **Result**: Pages with "MEXICO" and "UNIVERSITIES" but not "NEW"
   - **Google Format**: MEXICO UNIVERSITIES -NEW (using minus sign)

## 1.2.5 Logic Puzzles

### Purpose and Benefits
- **Skill Development**: Excellent practice for logical reasoning
- **Computer Applications**: Used to demonstrate logical reasoning programs
- **Recreation**: Popular entertainment activity
- **Problem-Solving**: Develops systematic thinking skills

### **Example 7: Treasure Trunk Puzzle**

**Problem Setup**:
- Three trunks, only one contains treasure
- Inscriptions:
  - Trunk 1: "This trunk is empty"
  - Trunk 2: "This trunk is empty" 
  - Trunk 3: "The treasure is in Trunk 2"
- Queen states: Exactly one inscription is true, two are false

**Solution Process**:
- **Variable Assignment**:
  - `p₁` = "Treasure is in Trunk 1"
  - `p₂` = "Treasure is in Trunk 2"
  - `p₃` = "Treasure is in Trunk 3"

- **Inscription Translation**:
  - Trunk 1: `¬p₁`
  - Trunk 2: `¬p₂`
  - Trunk 3: `p₂`

- **Queen's Statement**: Exactly one inscription is true
  - `(¬p₁ ∧ ¬(¬p₂) ∧ ¬p₂) ∨ (¬(¬p₁) ∧ ¬p₂ ∧ ¬p₂) ∨ (¬(¬p₁) ∧ ¬(¬p₂) ∧ p₂)`
  - Simplifying: `(¬p₁ ∧ p₂ ∧ ¬p₂) ∨ (p₁ ∧ ¬p₂ ∧ ¬p₂) ∨ (p₁ ∧ p₂ ∧ p₂)`
  - Further: `(p₁ ∧ ¬p₂) ∨ (p₁ ∧ p₂)`
  - By distributive law: `p₁ ∧ (¬p₂ ∨ p₂)`
  - Since `¬p₂ ∨ p₂` is always true: `p₁ ∧ T = p₁`

- **Conclusion**: The treasure is in Trunk 1

### **Example 8: Knights and Knaves Puzzle**

**Problem Setup**:
- Knights always tell the truth
- Knaves always lie
- Person A says: "B is a knight"
- Person B says: "The two of us are opposite types"
- Question: What are A and B?

**Solution Process**:
- **Variable Assignment**:
  - `p` = "A is a knight"
  - `q` = "B is a knight"

- **Case 1: Assume A is a knight** (`p = true`)
  - A tells truth, so B is a knight (`q = true`)
  - Both are knights (same type)
  - B's statement "we are opposite types" would be `(p ∧ ¬q) ∨ (¬p ∧ q)`
  - With `p = true, q = true`: `(true ∧ false) ∨ (false ∧ true) = false`
  - But knights tell truth, so B's statement should be true
  - **Contradiction**: A cannot be a knight

- **Case 2: A is a knave** (`p = false`)
  - A lies, so "B is a knight" is false, meaning B is a knave (`q = false`)
  - Both are knaves (same type)
  - B's statement "we are opposite types" should be false (since B lies)
  - With `p = false, q = false`: `(false ∧ true) ∨ (true ∧ false) = false`
  - **Consistent**: B's statement is false, as expected from a knave

- **Conclusion**: Both A and B are knaves

### **Example 9: Muddy Children Puzzle**

**Problem Setup**:
- Two children (boy and girl) both have muddy foreheads
- Each can see the other's forehead but not their own
- Father says: "At least one of you has a muddy forehead"
- Question asked twice: "Do you know whether you have a muddy forehead?"
- Children answer simultaneously and honestly

**Solution Process**:
- **Variable Assignment**:
  - `s` = "Son has muddy forehead"
  - `d` = "Daughter has muddy forehead"

- **Father's Statement**: `s ∨ d` (at least one is muddy)

- **First Question Round**:
  - Son sees daughter is muddy (`d = true`) but doesn't know about himself
  - Daughter sees son is muddy (`s = true`) but doesn't know about herself
  - **Both answer "No"**: Neither knows their own status

- **Second Question Round**:
  - **Daughter's Reasoning**: 
    - Son knows `s ∨ d` is true and sees `d = true`
    - If daughter weren't muddy (`d = false`), son would know `s = true` and answer "Yes"
    - Since son answered "No", daughter deduces `d = true`
  - **Son's Reasoning**: Similar logic leads to `s = true`
  - **Both answer "Yes"**: Both now know they are muddy
