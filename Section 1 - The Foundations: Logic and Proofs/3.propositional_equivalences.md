# 1.3 Propositional Equivalences - Complete Study Guide

## 1.3.1 Introduction to Tautologies, Contradictions, and Contingencies

### Key Definitions

**Tautology**: A compound proposition that is always true regardless of the truth values of its component propositions.

**Contradiction**: A compound proposition that is always false regardless of the truth values of its component propositions.

**Contingency**: A compound proposition that is neither a tautology nor a contradiction.

### Examples of Tautologies and Contradictions

| p | ¬p | p ∨ ¬p | p ∧ ¬p |
|---|----|---------|---------| 
| T | F  | T       | F       |
| F | T  | T       | F       |

- **p ∨ ¬p** is a tautology (always true)
- **p ∧ ¬p** is a contradiction (always false)

## 1.3.2 Logical Equivalences

### Definition
**Logical Equivalence**: Two compound propositions p and q are logically equivalent if p ↔ q is a tautology. We denote this as p ≡ q.

**Important Note**: The symbol ≡ is not a logical connective; p ≡ q is a statement that p ↔ q is a tautology.

### Example 2: De Morgan's Laws
**Problem**: Show that ¬(p ∨ q) and ¬p ∧ ¬q are logically equivalent.

**Solution**:
| p | q | p ∨ q | ¬(p ∨ q) | ¬p | ¬q | ¬p ∧ ¬q |
|---|---|-------|----------|----|----|----------|
| T | T | T     | F        | F  | F  | F        |
| T | F | T     | F        | F  | T  | F        |
| F | T | T     | F        | T  | F  | F        |
| F | F | F     | T        | T  | T  | T        |

Since the columns for ¬(p ∨ q) and ¬p ∧ ¬q are identical, they are logically equivalent.

### Example 3: Conditional-Disjunction Equivalence
**Problem**: Show that p → q and ¬p ∨ q are logically equivalent.

**Solution**:
| p | q | ¬p | ¬p ∨ q | p → q |
|---|---|----|---------|---------| 
| T | T | F  | T       | T       |
| T | F | F  | F       | F       |
| F | T | T  | T       | T       |
| F | F | T  | T       | T       |

Since the columns for ¬p ∨ q and p → q are identical, they are logically equivalent.

**Key Insight**: This equivalence allows us to replace conditional statements with negations and disjunctions.

### Example 4: Distributive Law
**Problem**: Show that p ∨ (q ∧ r) and (p ∨ q) ∧ (p ∨ r) are logically equivalent.

**Solution**:
| p | q | r | q ∧ r | p ∨ (q ∧ r) | p ∨ q | p ∨ r | (p ∨ q) ∧ (p ∨ r) |
|---|---|---|-------|-------------|-------|-------|-------------------|
| T | T | T | T     | T           | T     | T     | T                 |
| T | T | F | F     | T           | T     | T     | T                 |
| T | F | T | F     | T           | T     | T     | T                 |
| T | F | F | F     | T           | T     | T     | T                 |
| F | T | T | T     | T           | T     | T     | T                 |
| F | T | F | F     | F           | T     | F     | F                 |
| F | F | T | F     | F           | F     | T     | F                 |
| F | F | F | F     | F           | F     | F     | F                 |

The columns for p ∨ (q ∧ r) and (p ∨ q) ∧ (p ∨ r) are identical, proving they are logically equivalent.

## 1.3.4 Using De Morgan's Laws

### Example 5: Applying De Morgan's Laws
**Problem**: Use De Morgan's laws to express the negations of:
1. "Miguel has a cellphone and he has a laptop computer"
2. "Heather will go to the concert or Steve will go to the concert"

**Solution**:

**Part 1**: 
- Let p = "Miguel has a cellphone"
- Let q = "Miguel has a laptop computer"
- Original statement: p ∧ q
- Negation: ¬(p ∧ q) ≡ ¬p ∨ ¬q
- In words: "Miguel does not have a cellphone or he does not have a laptop computer"

**Part 2**:
- Let r = "Heather will go to the concert"
- Let s = "Steve will go to the concert"
- Original statement: r ∨ s
- Negation: ¬(r ∨ s) ≡ ¬r ∧ ¬s
- In words: "Heather will not go to the concert and Steve will not go to the concert"

### Extended De Morgan's Laws
For n propositions:
- ¬(p₁ ∨ p₂ ∨ ... ∨ pₙ) ≡ (¬p₁ ∧ ¬p₂ ∧ ... ∧ ¬pₙ)
- ¬(p₁ ∧ p₂ ∧ ... ∧ pₙ) ≡ (¬p₁ ∨ ¬p₂ ∨ ... ∨ ¬pₙ)

Using notation: ¬(⋁ⁿⱼ₌₁ pⱼ) ≡ ⋀ⁿⱼ₌₁ ¬pⱼ and ¬(⋀ⁿⱼ₌₁ pⱼ) ≡ ⋁ⁿⱼ₌₁ ¬pⱼ

## 1.3.5 Constructing New Logical Equivalences

### Example 6: Using Known Equivalences
**Problem**: Show that ¬(p → q) and p ∧ ¬q are logically equivalent.

**Solution**:
```
¬(p → q) ≡ ¬(¬p ∨ q)        [conditional-disjunction equivalence]
         ≡ ¬(¬p) ∧ ¬q        [De Morgan's law]
         ≡ p ∧ ¬q             [double negation law]
```

### Example 7: Complex Equivalence Chain
**Problem**: Show that ¬(p ∨ (¬p ∧ q)) and ¬p ∧ ¬q are logically equivalent.

**Solution**:
```
¬(p ∨ (¬p ∧ q)) ≡ ¬p ∧ ¬(¬p ∧ q)           [De Morgan's law]
                 ≡ ¬p ∧ [¬(¬p) ∨ ¬q]         [De Morgan's law]
                 ≡ ¬p ∧ (p ∨ ¬q)             [double negation law]
                 ≡ (¬p ∧ p) ∨ (¬p ∧ ¬q)      [distributive law]
                 ≡ F ∨ (¬p ∧ ¬q)             [negation law: ¬p ∧ p ≡ F]

**Solution**:
```
(p ∧ q) → (p ∨ q) ≡ ¬(p ∧ q) ∨ (p ∨ q)      [conditional-disjunction equivalence]
                   ≡ (¬p ∨ ¬q) ∨ (p ∨ q)      [De Morgan's law]
                   ≡ (¬p ∨ p) ∨ (¬q ∨ q)      [associative and commutative laws]
                   ≡ T ∨ T                     [negation law]
                   ≡ T                         [domination law]
```

Since the expression simplifies to T, it is a tautology.

## 1.3.6 Satisfiability

### Definitions
- **Satisfiable**: A compound proposition is satisfiable if there exists at least one assignment of truth values that makes it true.
- **Unsatisfiable**: A compound proposition is unsatisfiable if no assignment of truth values makes it true.
- **Solution**: A particular assignment of truth values that makes a compound proposition true.

### Example 9: Determining Satisfiability
**Problem**: Determine whether each compound proposition is satisfiable:
1. (p ∨ ¬q) ∧ (q ∨ ¬r) ∧ (r ∨ ¬p)
2. (p ∨ q ∨ r) ∧ (¬p ∨ ¬q ∨ ¬r)
3. (p ∨ ¬q) ∧ (q ∨ ¬r) ∧ (r ∨ ¬p) ∧ (p ∨ q ∨ r) ∧ (¬p ∨ ¬q ∨ ¬r)

**Solution**:

**Part 1**: (p ∨ ¬q) ∧ (q ∨ ¬r) ∧ (r ∨ ¬p)
- This is true when all three variables have the same truth value
- Example: p = T, q = T, r = T makes all three disjunctions true
- Therefore, it is **satisfiable**

**Part 2**: (p ∨ q ∨ r) ∧ (¬p ∨ ¬q ∨ ¬r)
- First part requires at least one variable to be true
- Second part requires at least one variable to be false
- Example: p = T, q = F, r = F satisfies both conditions
- Therefore, it is **satisfiable**

**Part 3**: All five parts together
- From Part 1: requires all three variables to have the same truth value
- From Part 2: requires at least one true and at least one false
- These conditions are contradictory
- Therefore, it is **unsatisfiable**

## 1.3.7 Applications of Satisfiability

### Example 10: The n-Queens Problem
**Problem**: Model the n-queens problem as a satisfiability problem.

**Solution**:
- **Variables**: p(i,j) for i,j = 1,2,...,n where p(i,j) is true if there's a queen at position (i,j)
- **Constraints**:
  - **Q₁**: Every row has at least one queen: ⋀ⁿᵢ₌₁ ⋁ⁿⱼ₌₁ p(i,j)
  - **Q₂**: Every row has at most one queen: ⋀ⁿᵢ₌₁ ⋀ⁿ⁻¹ⱼ₌₁ ⋀ⁿₖ₌ⱼ₊₁ (¬p(i,j) ∨ ¬p(i,k))
  - **Q₃**: Every column has at most one queen: ⋀ⁿⱼ₌₁ ⋀ⁿ⁻¹ᵢ₌₁ ⋀ⁿₖ₌ᵢ₊₁ (¬p(i,j) ∨ ¬p(k,j))
  - **Q₄** and **Q₅**: No two queens on the same diagonal

**Final Formula**: Q = Q₁ ∧ Q₂ ∧ Q₃ ∧ Q₄ ∧ Q₅

**Results**: 
- For n = 8: 92 solutions
- For n = 16: 14,772,512 solutions

### Example 11: Sudoku Puzzle
**Problem**: Model a Sudoku puzzle as a satisfiability problem.

**Solution**:
- **Variables**: p(i,j,n) for i,j,n = 1,2,...,9 where p(i,j,n) is true if number n is in cell (i,j)
- **Total Variables**: 9 × 9 × 9 = 729 propositions

**Constraints**:
1. **Given values**: For each given cell, assert p(i,j,n) for the given number n
2. **Every row contains every number**: ⋀⁹ᵢ₌₁ ⋀⁹ₙ₌₁ ⋁⁹ⱼ₌₁ p(i,j,n)
3. **Every column contains every number**: ⋀⁹ⱼ₌₁ ⋀⁹ₙ₌₁ ⋁⁹ᵢ₌₁ p(i,j,n)
4. **Every 3×3 block contains every number**: ⋀²ᵣ₌₀ ⋀²ₛ₌₀ ⋀⁹ₙ₌₁ ⋁³ᵢ₌₁ ⋁³ⱼ₌₁ p(3r+i, 3s+j, n)
5. **No cell contains more than one number**: For all i,j,n,n' where n ≠ n': p(i,j,n) → ¬p(i,j,n')

**Performance**: Modern satisfiability solvers can solve Sudoku puzzles in less than 10 milliseconds.
